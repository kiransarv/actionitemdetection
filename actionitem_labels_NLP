 Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. 1.0
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. 0.0
I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. 0.0
I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. 0.0
As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. 0.0
Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. 1.0
The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. 1.0
My suggestion for where to go is Austin. 0.0

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. 1.0
Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming. 0.0
Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). 1.0
What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. 1.0
This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. 1.0
Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 1.0

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. 1.0
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. 0.0
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? 1.0
San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. 1.0
The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. 1.0
Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. 0.0
This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. 1.0
If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. 1.0
The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. 1.0
I will know more on this question later today. 1.0

It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. 1.0
At the time of these trades,  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation. 0.0

The two key points from this data are as follows:   1. 0.0
The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 1.0

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. 1.0
LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. 1.0
Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. 0.0
If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced. 0.0
All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0
Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. 0.0
PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. 0.0
I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. 1.0
Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. 0.0

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0
Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. 0.0
PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. 0.0
I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. 1.0
Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. 0.0

Is the closing today?? 1.0
After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding  as far as I can determine.? 1.0
It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like  anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate  closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 1.0

If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 1.0

I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and  find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can. 0.0

atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 1.0

I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at  that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? 1.0
is even  needed to complete this transaction.? 1.0
I am in after 12 noon if there is any  need to contact me regarding the  closing. 1.0
? 1.0
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself  and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't  seem to be something required for a closing.? 1.0

*******************
As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. 1.0
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. 1.0
This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. 1.0
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. 1.0
As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. 1.0
Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. 0.0
I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. 1.0
Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. 1.0
The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. 1.0
Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. 1.0
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. 1.0
We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. 0.0
Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. 1.0
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. 1.0
This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. 1.0
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. 1.0
As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. 0.0
I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. 1.0
You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. 0.0
Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. 0.0
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. 1.0
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. 0.0
Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. 1.0
You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. 1.0
My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. 1.0
I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. 1.0
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. 1.0
A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. 0.0
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. 1.0
The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. 1.0
The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. 1.0
Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency. 1.0
She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. 1.0
There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. 1.0
Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. 0.0

This added 800 shorts to San Juan  and 200 longs to Socal. 1.0

*******************
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. 1.0
This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. 1.0
(I thought his sales price was $187,000.) 0.0
At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. 0.0
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability. 1.0
You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. 0.0
As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. 0.0
In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. 1.0
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly. 1.0
Sincerely, George W. Richards Creekside Builders, LLC 0.0
*******************
As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. 1.0
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. 1.0
This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. 1.0
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. 1.0
As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. 1.0
Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. 0.0
I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. 1.0
Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. 1.0
The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. 1.0
Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. 1.0
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. 1.0
We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. 0.0
Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. 1.0
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. 1.0
This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. 1.0
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. 1.0
As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. 0.0
I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. 1.0
You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. 0.0
Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. 0.0
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. 1.0
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. 0.0
Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. 1.0
You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. 1.0
My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. 1.0
I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. 1.0
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. 1.0
A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. 0.0
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. 1.0
The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. 1.0
The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. 1.0
Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency. 1.0
She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. 1.0
There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. 1.0
Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. 0.0

that were  built by Reagan Lehmann. 1.0
22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. 0.0

*******************
 Ina,   I scheduled a meeting with Jean Mrha tomorrow at 3:30 0.0
*******************
I  have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year. 1.0
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the  distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for  power quality reasons. 0.0
The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due  to server farms and technology companies. 1.0
There is a 100 MW server farm  trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months  due to distribution infrastructure issues. 1.0
Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years. 1.0
The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms. 1.0
Fast-forward to summer 2000. 1.0
Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. 0.0
Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com. 0.0
Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle. 0.0
More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy. 1.0
It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites. 1.0
Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities. 0.0
"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. 0.0
"That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries." 1.0
A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads. 1.0
Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. 1.0
The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. 0.0
Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said. 1.0
Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 0.0
For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue. 1.0
On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. 0.0
The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. 1.0
On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures. 0.0
Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate. 1.0
"These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads," said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light. 1.0
"The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 0.0
We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts." 1.0
With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. 0.0
Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. 1.0
In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies. 1.0
"It is probably the largest data center park in the  country," boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. 0.0
Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park. 1.0
After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. 0.0
Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country. 1.0
As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate. 0.0
But it is not just Seattle. 0.0
The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California. 0.0
Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 1.0
While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management. 0.0
"We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle. 1.0
The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed. 0.0
"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. 0.0
"The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way." 1.0

 Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG. 0.0
Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 1.0
Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. 1.0
I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. 0.0
Current price 37  Nat. 0.0
Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? 1.0
To me this  looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,  Tosco, and SLB? 1.0

Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some  price that undercuts the current provider. 1.0
Then once their sales are large  enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. 1.0
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage  the price risk. 1.0

The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. 1.0
For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice. 0.0
I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between "scheduled" and "actual"  generation. 0.0
You are pulling "scheduled." 0.0
If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that. 0.0
You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. 0.0
That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. 0.0
Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side. 0.0
On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. 1.0
While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the "scheduled" number. 0.0
The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. 1.0

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide. 1.0

as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future. 0.0
Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019. 0.0
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.) 1.0
Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 0.0
139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate. 0.0
Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections. 1.0
Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. 1.0
What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. 1.0
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. 0.0
In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. 1.0
Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. 1.0
There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it. 1.0
The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. 0.0

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. 1.0
I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. 1.0
Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position. 1.0
Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. 1.0
Hope this info helps. 0.0

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management. 1.0

*******************
Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline. 1.0
Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart. 0.0
According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. 0.0
The Democratic caucus is  reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis. 0.0
Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into  the fund. 0.0
Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor. 0.0
However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. 1.0
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. 1.0
If not, the state may be in breach of  contract. 1.0
Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult. 1.0
The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion. 1.0
However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession. 0.0
Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward. 1.0
Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X. 0.0
AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. 0.0
This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support. 0.0
AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts. 0.0
However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X. 1.0
Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 1.0
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund. 0.0
For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued. 0.0
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds. 0.0
The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday. 0.0
Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. 0.0
Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority. 1.0
The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward. 1.0
Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations. 1.0
Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support. 1.0
No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power. 1.0
Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. 0.0
for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. 0.0
However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis. 1.0
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. 0.0
The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor. 0.0
The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. 1.0
According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it. 1.0
The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. 1.0
If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. 1.0
The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount. 1.0
In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities. 0.0
If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy. 1.0
SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments. 0.0

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap. 1.0
I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. 1.0
Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position. 1.0
Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda. 1.0
Hope this info helps. 0.0

*******************
Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct. 1.0
At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%. 1.0
This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year. 1.0
Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to "forced" reductions via rolling blackouts). 1.0
Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June. 0.0
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. 1.0
Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year. 1.0
This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug. 1.0
In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. 1.0
Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. 0.0
Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load. 1.0
I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand. 0.0
As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. 1.0
As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish). 1.0
This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC. 1.0
Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production. 0.0
I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. 1.0
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. 0.0
While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer. 1.0
This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer. 1.0
I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available. 0.0
Meantime, I  hope this helps. 0.0

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. 0.0
I am ready to go ahead and  have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. 1.0
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. 0.0
As I mentioned my  alternative is $0.60/ft. 0.0
I thought that since I had a such a detailed  sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan  allowed. 0.0

 Jacques,  The agreement looks fine. 0.0
My only comment is that George and Larry might  object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the  construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs  of the construction of the Project". 1.0
Technically, that bank lowered the  loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of  equity that would be required. 1.0
Did I loan them $1,300,000? 1.0
I thought it was less. 0.0
Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans,  engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. 1.0
Most of these items are  in a state of partial completion by the consultants. 1.0
I have been speaking  directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. 0.0
I am unclear on  what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. 0.0
The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. 1.0
Do we  need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and  give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. 1.0

77002-7361  Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout  Dear Phillip and Keith:   We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash  expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of  all note obligations and design contracts.? 1.0
As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and  existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company,  and appraisal total $67,050.? 1.0
The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which  current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. 1.0
Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this  project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design  and other pre-construction elements.? 1.0
As it is a major project for a firm of  our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or  rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 1.0
Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a  percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on  your prior valuation of our time.? 1.0
For the first, we feel that at least 25%,  or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? 1.0
For the  second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per  year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? 1.0
Either of these  valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the  forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. 1.0
?However, in  the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future  projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per  month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? 1.0
As shown in the  attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings  the total net buyout to $78,946.? 1.0
We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? 1.0
However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 1.0
If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? 1.0
The attorneys can then  draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the  Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout  amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. 1.0

 Gentlemen,  Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to  date. 1.0
I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. 0.0
The property is  still in two parcels. 1.0
Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot  and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. 0.0
He has also completed a  topographical survey and a tree survey. 0.0
In addition, he has begun to  coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the  smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. 0.0
Hugo is going  to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to  complete. 1.0
The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which  $14,000 are due now for work completed. 1.0
We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by  the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. 0.0
If we can  continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. 0.0
Hugo's  number is 512-295-8052. 0.0
I thought you might want to contact him directly and  ask him some questions. 0.0
I spoke to him about the possibility of your call  and he was fine with that. 0.0

I need your expert advise. 0.0
I am ready to offer my version or threaten to  foreclose. 0.0
Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? 1.0
Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I  wouldn't think they would stand a chance. 0.0
There isn't any time to waste so I  want to respond to their offer asap. 1.0

As shown in the  attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings  the total net buyout to $78,946.? 1.0
We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? 1.0
However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 1.0
If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? 1.0
The attorneys can then  draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the  Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout  amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. 1.0
Thank you. 0.0

*******************
Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. 1.0
There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction. 1.0
First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. 0.0
We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. 1.0
Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project. 1.0
We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000. 1.0
I have summarized our issues as follows:  1. 0.0
Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2. 0.0
Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over. 0.0
3. 0.0
A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI). 0.0
4. 0.0
Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. 0.0
of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate. 1.0
5. 0.0
The debt service will be approx. 0.0
$874,000/year. 0.0
6. 0.0
Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:       Land -                   $1,121,670      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000      Cash Equity              $1,419,268      Total                    $2,955,938  7. 1.0
Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage  of actual hard construction costs. 0.0

*******************
 Darrell,  Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his  excessively high cost estimates. 1.0
As he did not have the funds to take on the  land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me. 1.0
I would like  to proceed and develop the property. 0.0
My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA. 1.0
I would  also like to compare construction and development services between what you  can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with. 0.0
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to  be in order. 1.0
I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural  work to date. 0.0
Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is  Quattro Consultants out of Buda. 1.0
Let me know if you have an opinion about  either. 0.0
I look forward to working with you. 0.0

*******************
 George,  I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. 0.0
I still have the concerns that I had last week. 1.0
Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. 0.0
I have gathered more information that support my concerns. 1.0
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. 0.0
The components are as follows:       Unit Cost, Site work, &      builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million       Land                      1.15       Interim Financing               .85       Common Areas                     .80       Total                         $10.4  Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. 1.0
Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. 1.0
It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. 0.0
There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. 0.0
I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. 1.0
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. 0.0
After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. 1.0
He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. 0.0
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. 0.0
Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. 0.0
We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to  discuss alternatives. 1.0

 Jaques,  After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different  definitions of cost and profit. 0.0
Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials. 1.0
Then there is a layer of "construction management"  fees of 10%. 0.0
There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money. 0.0
But I think the majority of it is profit. 0.0
Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million. 0.0
Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. 0.0
After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? 1.0
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs. 0.0
George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using. 1.0
I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included. 1.0
George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. 0.0
I will  review and let you know what I think. 0.0
The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. 1.0
They are agreeable to  the 3 out 4 approval process. 0.0
Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only  true costs + 1.4 million. 0.0

Sorry it is so late. 0.0
There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 0.0
1. 0.0
I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. 0.0
The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 1.0

 Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. 1.0
Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. 0.0
This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer. 1.0
After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash. 0.0

*******************
 Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. 1.0
There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this. 0.0
Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns. 0.0
What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. 1.0
The existing note does not come due  until September 2009. 1.0
That is a long time. 1.0
The buyer may have sold the  property. 1.0
Interest rates may be lower. 0.0
I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note. 0.0
Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far. 0.0
Can you clarify the dates in the contract. 1.0
Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? 1.0
Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. 1.0

But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third consecutive day. 1.0
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. 0.0
But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. 1.0
But that still wasn't enough juice. 0.0
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/MWh. 1.0
The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. 1.0
It is free sell power instate above the $250/MWh price cap. 0.0
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. 1.0
The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. 0.0
However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. 1.0
The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. 1.0
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. 0.0
But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. 1.0
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. 1.0
The ISO is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. 1.0
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. 1.0
A stage three is declared when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. 0.0
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. 0.0
"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation," Dorinson said. 0.0
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. 1.0
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. 0.0
The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. 1.0
It's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. 0.0

The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. 1.0
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. 1.0
The ISO manages grid reliability. 1.0
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. 1.0
However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. 1.0
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). 1.0
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said. 1.0

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. 1.0
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. 1.0
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. 1.0
The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. 1.0
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. 1.0
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. 1.0
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. 1.0
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection. 1.0
AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits  The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. 0.0
They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. 1.0
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. 0.0
The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. 0.0
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. 1.0
"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it," Thomas said. 0.0
"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality district's" authority. 1.0
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so. 1.0
Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. 1.0
"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. 1.0
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. 1.0
"We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said. 0.0
"We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited." 0.0
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. 1.0

 George,  The probability of building a house this year is increasing. 1.0
I have shifted  to a slightly different plan. 0.0
There were too many design items that I could  not work out in the plan we discussed previously. 1.0
Now, I am leaning more  towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. 1.0
One  wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3  kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. 0.0
The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. 0.0
This  plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the  courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor  living. 1.0
I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 1.0
The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass  skylights supported by metal posts. 1.0
I am envisioning the two wings to have  single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. 1.0
I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. 1.0
I would  like to come and visit you again this month. 1.0
If it would work for you, I  would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. 1.0
I  would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we  didn't have time for. 1.0

*******************
 Jeff,  Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 0.0
1. 0.0
Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and  repairs. 0.0
Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor  cost for repairs. 0.0
There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on  repairs. 1.0
2. 0.0
What is an outside management firm going to do? 1.0
A full time onsite  manager is all that is required. 0.0
As I mentioned the prior manager has  interest in returning. 0.0
Another alternative would be to hire a male manager  that could do more make readies and lawn care. 1.0
If you turn it over to a  management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager  onsite. 1.0
3. 0.0
Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. 0.0
If you  want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 0.0
4. 0.0
Getting cash out is not a priority to me. 0.0
So I am willing to structure  this deal with minimum cash. 0.0
A 10% note actually attractive. 0.0
See below. 0.0
My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. 0.0
This property  definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. 0.0
Sales Price  705,000  1st Lien   473,500  2nd Lien  225,000  Transfer fee    7,500  Cash required   14,500   NOI   100,000  1st Lien    47,292  2nd Lien   23,694  Cash flow  29,014  Cash on cash  200%   These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then  cash on cash return would be more like 300%. 1.0
This doesn't reflect the  additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years  for a higher price. 1.0
Do you want to reconsider? 1.0
Let me know. 0.0

*******************
Cash Needs Highlights: SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. 0.0
Since then SCE has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20 available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. 1.0
The actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. 0.0
II. 0.0
Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. 0.0
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. 0.0
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. 1.0
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. 0.0
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. 1.0
III. 0.0
Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. 1.0
Under=  such=20 scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. 0.0
IV. 0.0
Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. 1.0
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. 1.0
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. 0.0
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. 0.0
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20 Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20 Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. 0.0
This=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. 1.0
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s= =20 Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. 0.0
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th= e=20 end of each year. 1.0
However, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20 D.01-01-018. 0.0
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the TCBA. 0.0
Because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the TRA, are overstated. 0.0
TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU= RN=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. 1.0
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. 0.0
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=  the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the TRA is overstated. 1.0

During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. 0.0

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation. 1.0
At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. 1.0
Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. 0.0
However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract. 0.0
Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1. 1.0
Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. 0.0
Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 0.0
2. 0.0
+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45. 0.0

*******************
 By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15  As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile  Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas  storage number. 1.0
The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the  forecast was for frigid weather. 1.0
Traders put the two together, anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 0.0
"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson,  a trader. 0.0
"It makes the market for natural gas." 0.0
But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas  Association's director of gas supply and transportation. 0.0
He had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality. 1.0
"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what  we are reporting," McGill said. 0.0
As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --  and culprits -- is on. 0.0
Some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at Wall Street. 0.0
Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for  the rise in gas prices. 0.0
"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik  told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 1.0
In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 0.0
Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes. 1.0
Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take  precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price  insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared. 1.0
"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul  Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 0.0
But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 1.0
"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to  change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security  Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 1.0
Hot topic   Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. 0.0
In  many circles, little else is discussed. 0.0
The Rev. 0.0
Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is  facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the  previous December's bill. 1.0
Church members are suffering from higher bills as  well. 0.0
The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of  his salary. 1.0
For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 1.0
"It's the talk of the town here," he said. 0.0
A year ago that wasn't a fear. 1.0
Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per  thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile  to drill for gas. 1.0
Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers. 1.0
But trouble was brewing. 0.0
By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand  cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter. 0.0
There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. 0.0
By early November,  prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. 0.0
The federal Energy Information  Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 1.0
But $10 gas was coming. 0.0
Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,  including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets. 0.0
"It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 0.0
Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York  traders. 0.0
Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile  commodity in the world. 0.0
Setting the price   In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas, allowing it to float. 1.0
In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices. 1.0
The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years. 1.0
Suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce. 1.0
And big gas consumers, from  utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use. 1.0
There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas. 0.0
But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to  know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. 1.0
Like all  futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. 1.0
That leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time. 1.0
As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than $7 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 1.0
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's  weekly storage numbers. 1.0
Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter. 1.0
Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in  hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 1.0
Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient. 1.0
But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 0.0
Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994. 1.0
Still, said the  association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 0.0
But some utility executives didn't share that view. 1.0
William Eliason, vice  president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had  continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 1.0
"I was getting worried," he said. 0.0
Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 1.0
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices  dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
Just passing through   Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but  pass their fuel costs on to customers. 1.0
Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas  charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
And Missouri Gas  Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 1.0
Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last  month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could  be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve  energy. 1.0
Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to  save an average customer about $25 this winter. 1.0
Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. 0.0
It waited until fall to seek an  extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not  guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 0.0
Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left  customers with such high gas bills. 1.0
And regulators are being asked whether  they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel  costs. 0.0
On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public  Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to  perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 1.0
"Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. 0.0
"It's time to consider  some changes." 0.0

 George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders  profit. 1.0
Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation. 1.0
At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. 1.0
Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. 0.0
However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract. 0.0
Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1. 1.0
Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. 0.0
Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 0.0
2. 0.0
+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45. 0.0
I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon. 0.0

I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes. 1.0
If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor. 1.0
Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. 1.0
This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. 1.0

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself. 0.0
The gov. 0.0
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas. 1.0
He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. 1.0
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared. 1.0
Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. 1.0
The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. 1.0
His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. 1.0
He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level. 0.0
He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW). 1.0
He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. 1.0
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided). 1.0
He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. 1.0
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases. 1.0
As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. 1.0
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". 1.0
Some of these ideas would require legislative action. 1.0
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of  generation plants. 0.0
The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. 1.0
This  was a frequently recurring theme. 0.0
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. 1.0
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. 0.0
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. 0.0
Expand in-state gas production. 0.0
Take state lands gas royalties in kind. 0.0
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. 0.0
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. 1.0
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. 0.0
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). 0.0
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. 0.0
We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. 0.0
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. 0.0
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. 1.0
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. 0.0
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. 0.0
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. 0.0
Thanks to everyone for their help. 0.0
We made some progress today. 1.0

As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1. 0.0
Examine LDC's incentive rate program. 0.0
Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost. 1.0
The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. 1.0
This creates a shortage in later months. 1.0
2. 0.0
California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand. 0.0
Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. 0.0
Specific questions should include:      1. 0.0
Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage? 1.0
2. 0.0
Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system. 1.0
I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand. 0.0
They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less. 0.0
3. 0.0
Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices. 0.0
Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs. 0.0
By design the customers are short at a floating  rate. 1.0

*******************
Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%. 0.0
This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. 1.0
Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high. 0.0
Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF. 1.0
It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. 0.0
However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM. 0.0
I hope to finish the proforma today. 1.0
The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom. 0.0
Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month. 1.0

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline. 1.0
Any possibility for a=  deal has reportedly fallen apart. 0.0
According to sources, both the Republic= ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. 0.0
The Democratic cauc= us is reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis. 0.0
Many legislative Republic= ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o= nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double=  dip" into the fund. 1.0
Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg= islature and the governor. 0.0
However, it is believed once Davis discloses th= e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac= e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon= g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t= hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. 1.0
If not, the state may be in = breach of contract. 1.0
Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th= e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi= ll be very difficult. 1.0
The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat= e would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately = $8 billion. 1.0
However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this = concession. 0.0
Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful= l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the = details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=  will support the bond issuance to go forward. 1.0
Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB = 31X. 0.0
AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. 0.0
This bi= ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac= k of Republican support. 1.0
AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo= r community college districts. 0.0
However, sources report this bill may be am= ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre= ntly in AB 8X. 1.0
Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get = paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li= kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20 =20 According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic= ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in = the General Fund. 1.0
For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 = of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued. 0.0
Other Republ= icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds. 0.0
The Republicans intend=  to bring this up in debate on  Monday. 0.0
Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo= rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind= ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. 1.0
=20 Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 B Lenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B =09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B =09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M Tax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77% =09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77% Current Projected=20 Blended IR:=09=095.38% Maturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t= he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority. 1.0
The $5 billion=  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut= horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi= tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power = going forward. 1.0
Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz= ations. 1.0
Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor = has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is = that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. 1.0
No f= urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it = is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas= ing power. 1.0
Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. 0.0
for  the Calif= ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority. 0.0
However, this can  be consi= dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl= ier in the crisis. 1.0
=20 SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. 0.0
T= he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the = governor. 0.0
The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au= gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. 1.0
According t= o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s= igned it. 1.0
The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi= s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. 1.0
If the legislature indicat= es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank= ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. 1.0
=20  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is= suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s= tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th= en the utilities would receive the residual amount. 1.0
In other words, the st= ate will get paid before the utilities. 1.0
If this language is included and p= assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=  bankruptcy. 1.0
SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=  the DWR proportionately from rate payments. 0.0

*******************
The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. 1.0
LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. 1.0
Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. 0.0
If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced. 0.0
All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0
Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. 0.0
PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. 0.0
I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. 1.0
Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. 0.0

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. 1.0
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. 0.0
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? 1.0
San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. 1.0
The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. 1.0
Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. 0.0
This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. 1.0
If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. 1.0
The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. 1.0
I will know more on this question later today. 1.0

It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. 1.0
At the time of these trades,  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation. 0.0
Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated  financial swaps for San Juan. 1.0
We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27. 0.0

Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary. 1.0
We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships. 1.0
The two key points from this data are as follows:   1. 0.0
The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 1.0

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. 1.0
LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. 1.0
Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. 0.0
If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced. 0.0
All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0

Is the closing today?? 1.0
After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding  as far as I can determine.? 1.0
It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like  anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate  closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 1.0

If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 1.0

I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and  find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can. 0.0

I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable  document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 1.0

atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 1.0

I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at  that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? 1.0
is even  needed to complete this transaction.? 1.0
I am in after 12 noon if there is any  need to contact me regarding the  closing. 1.0

I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself  and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't  seem to be something required for a closing.? 1.0

*******************
As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. 1.0
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. 1.0
This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. 1.0
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. 1.0
As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. 1.0
Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. 0.0
I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. 1.0
Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. 1.0
The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. 1.0
Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. 1.0
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. 1.0
We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. 0.0
Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. 1.0
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. 1.0
This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. 1.0
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. 1.0
As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. 0.0
I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. 1.0
You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. 0.0
Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. 0.0
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. 1.0
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. 0.0
Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. 1.0
You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. 1.0
My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. 1.0
I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. 1.0
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. 1.0
A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. 0.0
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. 1.0
The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. 1.0
The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. 1.0
Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency. 1.0
She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. 1.0
There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. 1.0
Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. 0.0

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. 1.0
This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. 1.0
(I thought his sales price was $187,000.) 0.0
At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. 0.0
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability. 1.0
You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. 0.0
As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. 0.0
In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. 1.0

*******************
I  have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year. 1.0
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the  distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for  power quality reasons. 0.0
The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due  to server farms and technology companies. 1.0
There is a 100 MW server farm  trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months  due to distribution infrastructure issues. 1.0
Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years. 1.0
The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms. 1.0
Fast-forward to summer 2000. 1.0
Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. 0.0
Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com. 0.0
Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle. 0.0
More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy. 1.0
It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites. 1.0
Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities. 0.0
"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. 0.0
"That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries." 1.0
A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads. 1.0
Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. 1.0
The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. 0.0
Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said. 1.0
Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 0.0
For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue. 1.0
On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. 0.0
The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. 1.0
On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures. 0.0
Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate. 1.0
"These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads," said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light. 1.0
"The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 0.0
We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts." 1.0
With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. 0.0
Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. 1.0
In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies. 1.0
"It is probably the largest data center park in the  country," boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. 0.0
Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park. 1.0
After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. 0.0
Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country. 1.0
As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate. 0.0
But it is not just Seattle. 0.0
The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California. 0.0
Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 1.0
While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management. 0.0
"We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle. 1.0
The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed. 0.0
"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. 0.0
"The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way." 1.0

 Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG. 0.0
Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 1.0
Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. 1.0
I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. 0.0
Current price 37  Nat. 0.0
Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? 1.0

Now that we have had several traders  managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss  any issues you have with the way the model works. 1.0
I have asked Zimin Lu  (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they  will be available to answer any technical questions. 0.0
The point of this  meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is  comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those  who are managing the books believe in the model's results. 1.0
Since I have  heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to  discuss them. 0.0

I think  I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from  him. 0.0
Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some  price that undercuts the current provider. 1.0
Then once their sales are large  enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. 1.0
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage  the price risk. 1.0

The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. 1.0
For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice. 0.0
I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between "scheduled" and "actual"  generation. 0.0
You are pulling "scheduled." 0.0
If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that. 0.0
You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. 0.0
That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. 0.0
Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side. 0.0
On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. 1.0
While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the "scheduled" number. 0.0
The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. 1.0

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide. 1.0
Let me know if this is  O.K. 1.0
as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future. 0.0
Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019. 0.0
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.) 1.0
Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 0.0
139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate. 0.0
Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections. 1.0
Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. 1.0
What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. 1.0
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. 0.0
In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. 1.0
Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. 1.0
There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it. 1.0
The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. 0.0

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management. 1.0

Are there any services we provide? 1.0
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? 1.0
Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas? 1.0
We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets. 0.0
For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions. 0.0
This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like. 1.0
Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. 1.0

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth. 1.0
According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths, this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our Master of Lime, 'Arry . 1.0

 Folks,  I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I think will be interesting to the group. 0.0
I highly recommend David Moore's book "The Roman Pantheon" at $25.00  -   a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. 0.0
The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. 1.0
I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. 0.0
David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. 1.0
A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks. 0.0

~ -Karyn Rispoli   Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up       Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said. 1.0

*******************
Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline. 1.0
Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart. 0.0
According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. 0.0
The Democratic caucus is  reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis. 0.0
Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into  the fund. 0.0
Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor. 0.0
However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. 1.0
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. 1.0
If not, the state may be in breach of  contract. 1.0
Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult. 1.0
The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion. 1.0
However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession. 0.0
Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward. 1.0
Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X. 0.0
AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. 0.0
This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support. 0.0
AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts. 0.0
However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X. 1.0
Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 1.0
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund. 0.0
For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued. 0.0
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds. 0.0
The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday. 0.0
Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. 0.0
Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority. 1.0
The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward. 1.0
Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations. 1.0
Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support. 1.0
No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power. 1.0
Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. 0.0
for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. 0.0
However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis. 1.0
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. 0.0
The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor. 0.0
The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. 1.0
According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it. 1.0
The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. 1.0
If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. 1.0
The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount. 1.0
In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities. 0.0
If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy. 1.0
SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments. 0.0

 Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. 1.0

*******************
Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap. 1.0
I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. 1.0
Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position. 1.0
Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda. 1.0
Hope this info helps. 0.0

*******************
Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct. 1.0
At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%. 1.0
This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year. 1.0
Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to "forced" reductions via rolling blackouts). 1.0
Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June. 0.0
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. 1.0
Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year. 1.0
This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug. 1.0
In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. 1.0
Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. 0.0
Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load. 1.0
I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand. 0.0
As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. 1.0
As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish). 1.0
This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC. 1.0
Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production. 0.0
I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. 1.0
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. 0.0
While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer. 1.0
This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer. 1.0
I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available. 0.0
Meantime, I  hope this helps. 0.0

 Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. 0.0
Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? 1.0
What role would you play in obtaining financing? 1.0
Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans? 1.0
Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet. 1.0
I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. 0.0
I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. 0.0
As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. 1.0
I am not thrilled about  such a low return. 0.0
I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. 1.0
Any ideas? 1.0
I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you  local connections. 0.0
I am not discounting those services. 0.0
I will be out of  the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. 1.0

I was going for a simple farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley. 0.0
A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:  There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40   What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. 1.0
More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. 0.0
Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. 0.0
I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. 0.0
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. 1.0
Also the front porch would be smaller. 0.0
I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. 0.0
I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. 1.0
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. 0.0
As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. 0.0
I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed. 0.0

My only comment is that George and Larry might  object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the  construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs  of the construction of the Project". 1.0
Technically, that bank lowered the  loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of  equity that would be required. 1.0

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/MWh. 1.0
The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. 1.0
It is free sell power instate above the $250/MWh price cap. 0.0
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. 1.0
The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. 0.0
However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. 1.0
The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. 1.0
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. 0.0
But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. 1.0
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. 1.0
The ISO is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. 1.0
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. 1.0
A stage three is declared when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. 0.0
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. 0.0
"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation," Dorinson said. 0.0
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. 1.0
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. 0.0
The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. 1.0
It's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. 0.0

The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. 1.0
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. 1.0
The ISO manages grid reliability. 1.0
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. 1.0
However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. 1.0
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). 1.0
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said. 1.0
-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line Power Plants (This article was originally published Wednesday)     By Jessica Berthold    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. 1.0
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. 1.0
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. 1.0
The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. 1.0
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. 1.0
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. 1.0
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. 1.0
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection. 1.0
AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits  The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. 0.0
They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. 1.0
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. 0.0
The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. 0.0
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. 1.0
"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it," Thomas said. 0.0
"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality district's" authority. 1.0
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so. 1.0
Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. 1.0
"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. 1.0
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. 1.0
"We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said. 0.0
"We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited." 0.0
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. 1.0

Phillip Allen  Keith Holst  ENRON  1400 Smith Street  Houston, TX? 1.0
77002-7361  Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout  Dear Phillip and Keith:   We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash  expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of  all note obligations and design contracts.? 1.0
As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and  existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company,  and appraisal total $67,050.? 1.0
The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which  current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. 1.0
Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this  project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design  and other pre-construction elements.? 1.0
As it is a major project for a firm of  our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or  rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 1.0
Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a  percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on  your prior valuation of our time.? 1.0
For the first, we feel that at least 25%,  or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? 1.0
For the  second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per  year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? 1.0
Either of these  valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the  forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. 1.0
?However, in  the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future  projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per  month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? 1.0
As shown in the  attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings  the total net buyout to $78,946.? 1.0
We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? 1.0
However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 1.0
If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? 1.0
The attorneys can then  draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the  Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout  amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. 1.0

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this  project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design  and other pre-construction elements.? 1.0
As it is a major project for a firm of  our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or  rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 1.0
Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a  percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on  your prior valuation of our time.? 1.0
For the first, we feel that at least 25%,  or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? 1.0
For the  second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per  year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? 1.0
Either of these  valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the  forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. 1.0
?However, in  the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future  projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per  month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? 1.0
As shown in the  attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings  the total net buyout to $78,946.? 1.0
We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? 1.0
However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 1.0
If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? 1.0
The attorneys can then  draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the  Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout  amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. 1.0
Thank you. 0.0

*******************
Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. 1.0
There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction. 1.0
First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. 0.0
We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. 1.0
Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project. 1.0
We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000. 1.0
I have summarized our issues as follows:  1. 0.0
Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2. 0.0
Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over. 0.0
3. 0.0
A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI). 0.0
4. 0.0
Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. 0.0
of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate. 1.0
5. 0.0
The debt service will be approx. 0.0
$874,000/year. 0.0
6. 0.0
Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:       Land -                   $1,121,670      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000      Cash Equity              $1,419,268      Total                    $2,955,938  7. 1.0
Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage  of actual hard construction costs. 0.0

 George,  I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. 0.0
I still have the concerns that I had last week. 1.0
Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. 0.0
I have gathered more information that support my concerns. 1.0
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. 0.0
The components are as follows:       Unit Cost, Site work, &      builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million       Land                      1.15       Interim Financing               .85       Common Areas                     .80       Total                         $10.4  Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. 1.0
Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. 1.0
It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. 0.0
There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. 0.0
I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. 1.0
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. 0.0
After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. 1.0
He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. 0.0
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. 0.0
Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. 0.0
We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to  discuss alternatives. 1.0

 Jaques,  After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different  definitions of cost and profit. 0.0
Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials. 1.0
Then there is a layer of "construction management"  fees of 10%. 0.0
There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money. 0.0
But I think the majority of it is profit. 0.0
Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million. 0.0
Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. 0.0
After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? 1.0
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs. 0.0
George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using. 1.0
I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included. 1.0
George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. 0.0
I will  review and let you know what I think. 0.0
The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. 1.0
They are agreeable to  the 3 out 4 approval process. 0.0
Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only  true costs + 1.4 million. 0.0

Sorry it is so late. 0.0
There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 0.0
1. 0.0
I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. 0.0
The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 1.0
2. 0.0
#1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 1.0

5. 0.0
60/40 split favoring the investors. 0.0
With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs. 0.0
Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. 0.0
Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping. 0.0

This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer. 1.0
After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash. 0.0

*******************
 Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. 1.0
There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this. 0.0
Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns. 0.0
What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. 1.0
The existing note does not come due  until September 2009. 1.0
That is a long time. 1.0
The buyer may have sold the  property. 1.0
Interest rates may be lower. 0.0
I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note. 0.0
Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far. 0.0
Can you clarify the dates in the contract. 1.0
Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? 1.0
Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. 1.0

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right  now. 0.0
I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet  but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. 1.0
As Gary and Wade  continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the  property's tenants and reputation. 0.0
The apartments are looking better and  better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. 1.0
Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. 1.0
It  is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move  in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. 1.0
I  realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and  your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be  working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running  an errand for the property. 1.0
I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this  time. 1.0
We can look at again later in the year. 1.0

 George,  The probability of building a house this year is increasing. 1.0
I have shifted  to a slightly different plan. 0.0
There were too many design items that I could  not work out in the plan we discussed previously. 1.0
Now, I am leaning more  towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. 1.0
One  wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3  kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. 0.0
The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. 0.0
This  plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the  courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor  living. 1.0
I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 1.0
The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass  skylights supported by metal posts. 1.0
I am envisioning the two wings to have  single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. 1.0
I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. 1.0
I would  like to come and visit you again this month. 1.0
If it would work for you, I  would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. 1.0

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and  repairs. 0.0
Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor  cost for repairs. 0.0
There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on  repairs. 1.0
2. 0.0
What is an outside management firm going to do? 1.0
A full time onsite  manager is all that is required. 0.0
As I mentioned the prior manager has  interest in returning. 0.0
Another alternative would be to hire a male manager  that could do more make readies and lawn care. 1.0
If you turn it over to a  management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager  onsite. 1.0
3. 0.0
Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. 0.0
If you  want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 0.0
4. 0.0
Getting cash out is not a priority to me. 0.0
So I am willing to structure  this deal with minimum cash. 0.0
A 10% note actually attractive. 0.0
See below. 0.0
My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. 0.0
This property  definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. 0.0
Sales Price  705,000  1st Lien   473,500  2nd Lien  225,000  Transfer fee    7,500  Cash required   14,500   NOI   100,000  1st Lien    47,292  2nd Lien   23,694  Cash flow  29,014  Cash on cash  200%   These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then  cash on cash return would be more like 300%. 1.0
This doesn't reflect the  additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years  for a higher price. 1.0
Do you want to reconsider? 1.0
Let me know. 0.0

*******************
Cash Needs Highlights: SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. 0.0
Since then SCE has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20 available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. 1.0
The actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. 0.0
II. 0.0
Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. 0.0
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. 0.0
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. 1.0
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. 0.0
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. 1.0
III. 0.0
Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. 1.0
Under=  such=20 scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. 0.0
IV. 0.0
Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. 1.0
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. 1.0
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. 0.0
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. 0.0
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20 Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20 Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. 0.0
This=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. 1.0
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s= =20 Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. 0.0
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th= e=20 end of each year. 1.0
However, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20 D.01-01-018. 0.0
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the TCBA. 0.0
Because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the TRA, are overstated. 0.0
TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU= RN=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. 1.0
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. 0.0
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=  the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the TRA is overstated. 1.0
VI. 0.0
Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. 1.0
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. 0.0
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. 1.0
[there is no Section VII] =20 VIII. 0.0
Earnings of California Affiliates SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period. 1.0

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation. 1.0
At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. 1.0
Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. 0.0
However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract. 0.0
Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1. 1.0

+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45. 0.0

 By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15  As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile  Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas  storage number. 1.0
The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the  forecast was for frigid weather. 1.0
Traders put the two together, anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 0.0
"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson,  a trader. 0.0
"It makes the market for natural gas." 0.0
But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas  Association's director of gas supply and transportation. 0.0
He had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality. 1.0
"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what  we are reporting," McGill said. 0.0
As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --  and culprits -- is on. 0.0
Some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at Wall Street. 0.0
Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for  the rise in gas prices. 0.0
"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik  told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 1.0
In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 0.0
Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes. 1.0
Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take  precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price  insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared. 1.0
"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul  Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 0.0
But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 1.0
"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to  change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security  Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 1.0
Hot topic   Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. 0.0
In  many circles, little else is discussed. 0.0
The Rev. 0.0
Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is  facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the  previous December's bill. 1.0
Church members are suffering from higher bills as  well. 0.0
The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of  his salary. 1.0
For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 1.0
"It's the talk of the town here," he said. 0.0
A year ago that wasn't a fear. 1.0
Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per  thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile  to drill for gas. 1.0
Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers. 1.0
But trouble was brewing. 0.0
By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand  cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter. 0.0
There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. 0.0
By early November,  prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. 0.0
The federal Energy Information  Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 1.0
But $10 gas was coming. 0.0
Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,  including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets. 0.0
"It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 0.0
Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York  traders. 0.0
Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile  commodity in the world. 0.0
Setting the price   In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas, allowing it to float. 1.0
In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices. 1.0
The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years. 1.0
Suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce. 1.0
And big gas consumers, from  utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use. 1.0
There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas. 0.0
But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to  know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. 1.0
Like all  futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. 1.0
That leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time. 1.0
As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than $7 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 1.0
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's  weekly storage numbers. 1.0
Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter. 1.0
Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in  hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 1.0
Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient. 1.0
But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 0.0
Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994. 1.0
Still, said the  association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 0.0
But some utility executives didn't share that view. 1.0
William Eliason, vice  president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had  continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 1.0
"I was getting worried," he said. 0.0
Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 1.0
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices  dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
Just passing through   Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but  pass their fuel costs on to customers. 1.0
Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas  charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
And Missouri Gas  Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 1.0
Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last  month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could  be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve  energy. 1.0
Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to  save an average customer about $25 this winter. 1.0
Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. 0.0
It waited until fall to seek an  extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not  guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 0.0
Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left  customers with such high gas bills. 1.0
And regulators are being asked whether  they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel  costs. 0.0
On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public  Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to  perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 1.0
"Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. 0.0
"It's time to consider  some changes." 0.0

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%. 0.0
This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. 1.0
Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high. 0.0
Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF. 1.0
It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. 0.0
However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM. 0.0
I hope to finish the proforma today. 1.0
The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom. 0.0
Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month. 1.0

 George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders  profit. 1.0
Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation. 1.0
At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. 1.0
Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. 0.0
However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract. 0.0
Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1. 1.0
Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. 0.0
Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 0.0
2. 0.0
+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45. 0.0
I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon. 0.0
Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip 0.0

 Questions about 12/29 rentroll:   There were two deposits that were not labeled. 0.0
One for $150 and the other  for $75. 0.0
Which apartments? 1.0
20a or #13? 1.0
Utility overages for #26 and #44? 1.0
Where did you get these amounts? 1.0
For  what periods? 1.0
What is going on with #42. 1.0
Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! 1.0
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money  and time remodeling. 1.0
I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes. 1.0
If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor. 1.0
Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. 1.0
This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. 1.0
I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so  I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. 1.0
Is this  right? 1.0
Has the deposit been made yet? 1.0
A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly. 1.0

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself. 0.0
The gov. 0.0
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas. 1.0
He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. 1.0
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared. 1.0
Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. 1.0
The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. 1.0
His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. 1.0
He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level. 0.0
He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW). 1.0
He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. 1.0
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided). 1.0
He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. 1.0
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases. 1.0
As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. 1.0
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". 1.0
Some of these ideas would require legislative action. 1.0
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of  generation plants. 0.0
The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. 1.0
This  was a frequently recurring theme. 0.0
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. 1.0
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. 0.0
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. 0.0
Expand in-state gas production. 0.0
Take state lands gas royalties in kind. 0.0
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. 0.0
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. 1.0
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. 0.0
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). 0.0
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. 0.0
We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. 0.0
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. 0.0
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. 1.0
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. 0.0
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. 0.0
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. 0.0
Thanks to everyone for their help. 0.0
We made some progress today. 1.0

 Jim,   I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I  described to you last week. 1.0
The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in  San Marcos. 1.0
There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a  couple of other investors involved. 0.0
As I mentioned last week, I would like  to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not  require the investors to personally guarantee. 1.0
If there is a creative way to  structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. 0.0
One idea that has  been mentioned is to obtain a "forward commitment" in order to reduce the  equity required. 1.0
I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this  nature are normally financed. 0.0
Specifically, the transition from interim to  permanent financing. 0.0
I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be  important to banks. 0.0
I am faxing you a project summary. 0.0

If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. 0.0
As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1. 0.0
Examine LDC's incentive rate program. 0.0
Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost. 1.0
The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. 1.0
This creates a shortage in later months. 1.0
2. 0.0
California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand. 0.0
Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. 0.0
Specific questions should include:      1. 0.0
Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage? 1.0
2. 0.0
Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system. 1.0
I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand. 0.0
They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less. 0.0
3. 0.0
Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices. 0.0
Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs. 0.0
By design the customers are short at a floating  rate. 1.0
This market has been long historically. 0.0
It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted. 0.0

Is your understanding that the West desk  will receive origination each month based on the schedule below. 1.0
The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as  follows:  October 2000  $1,395,000 November 2000 $1,350,000 December 2000 $1,395,000 January 2001  $   669,600 February 2001  $   604,800 March 2001  $   669,600 April 2001  $   648,000 May 2001  $   669,600 June 2001  $   648,000 July 2001  $   669,600 August 2001  $   669,600 September 2001 $   648,000 October 2001  $   669,600 November 2001 $   648,000 December 2001 $   669,600  This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by  the Denver desk. 1.0

*******************
The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. 1.0
LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. 1.0
Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. 0.0
If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced. 0.0
All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0
Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. 0.0
PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. 0.0
I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. 1.0
Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. 0.0

  Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. 1.0
As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment. 1.0
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). 1.0
We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now. 0.0
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com. 1.0
Thank you for your support. 0.0
The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. 1.0
We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). 0.0
Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already. 1.0
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. 1.0
It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses. 0.0
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. 1.0
For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com. 1.0
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. 1.0
If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center. 1.0
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. 1.0
Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. 0.0
If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com. 0.0
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support. 0.0

 A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us. 1.0
Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer). 0.0
Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron. 0.0
The laundry list of topics discussed is attached. 0.0
We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO. 1.0
We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process. 0.0
However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this. 0.0
We will try to get others to sign on to the comments. 0.0
Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:  	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). 1.0
Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). 0.0
Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). 0.0
All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes. 1.0
Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future. 0.0
This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us. 1.0

=09     Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=  start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te= rry Glenn and James McKnight? 1.0
Who would you recommend starting out of Duce = Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? 1.0
Answe= r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai= nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a= nd three touchdowns last weekend. 1.0
Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=  not an option. 0.0
Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t= o go with Carter in this case. 1.0
This season has been very unpredictable, so = going with your most established player in this case is the best move. 1.0
To a= nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol= ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. 0.0
It's tough to choose Davis, but=  Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=  best, so our hands are tied. 0.0
=09     Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th= is week. 1.0
I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink= e. What do you recommend? 1.0
Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist= ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. 0.0
He'll be = facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=  like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. 1.0
Weinke could have a b= ig game. 0.0
=09     Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan= non Sharpe or Bubba Franks? 1.0
Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? 1.0
Kevin J= ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av= ailable. 0.0
Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i= n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. 0.0
Sha= rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi= ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his = current pace of one per game. 0.0
As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not = good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=  will be inconsistent at best. 1.0
Your best bet is to drop him and go after an= other No. 0.0
1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa= ntasy player. 0.0
=09       Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start = giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? 1.0
He is the best offensive optio= n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a= fter five weeks. 1.0
With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=  will continue to be a productive player all season. 1.0

 Don't know if you saw this already. 0.0
Interesting. 0.0
Ken  Indigestion  Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01   All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? 1.0
Maybe not. 0.0
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. 1.0
Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. 0.0
Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. 1.0
(A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) 0.0
Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. 0.0
But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. 1.0
Studness determined that 79% of the "new" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. 1.0
And there's plenty more where that came from. 0.0
Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. 1.0
Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. 0.0
Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). 1.0
Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. 0.0
So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. 1.0
Addressing a Burning Issue  If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. 1.0
Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn. 0.0
WINNERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks  Calpine 				$4.6 		Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years  Chesapeake Energy 		0.9 		Hedged gas production through December 2003  Dynegy 			43.4 		Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas  Peabody Energy 		2.7 		World's largest coal company   LOSERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks  Devon Energy 			3.3 Gas-heavy; 	$8 billion in ...debt   General Electric 		129.5 		Sells gas turbines  Pioneer Natural Resources 	1.0 		$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas  Transocean SedcoForex 	1.9 		$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure      *Latest 12 months. 1.0

"It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear," says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. 1.0
"It's our game to displace older gas." 0.0
Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. 1.0
The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. 0.0
Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. 0.0
That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. 1.0
Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are "huge capital hogs," Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. 1.0
Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. 0.0
But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. 0.0
Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. 1.0
By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. 1.0
John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. 1.0
Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. 0.0
In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire. 0.0

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p= ercent from a year ago. 1.0
Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio= n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. 1.0
The company's return on e= quity was 14.2 percent. 0.0
Results for the third quarter were negatively aff= ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge=  of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the = September 11th terrorist attacks. 1.0
The September 11th events resulted in c= ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio= ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i= nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. 1.0
The combination = of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after= -tax). 1.0
The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=  September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. 1.0
Consequentl= y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. 1.0
These include the cost=  of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th= e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery = expenses. 1.0
Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra = operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat= ed. 0.0
The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=  will be covered by insurance. 1.0
The third quarter restructuring charge inc= ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a= sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor= ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i= n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio= ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr= ocessing and service functions to the Internet. 1.0
These initiatives are expec= ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. 1.0
A por= tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o= f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves= ted back into high-growth areas of the business. 1.0
In addition to the activ= ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=  on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea= r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. 1.0
=   Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-= time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down = 19 percent. 1.0
On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce= nt. 0.0
The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent. 0.0
"While we w= ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro= rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and = we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv= estment activity slowed after September 11th," said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch= airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. 1.0
"In light of = the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=  our operating expenses. 0.0
The progress we are making on our reengineering in= itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business= es with the strongest growth potential. 1.0
This, along with the anticipated be= nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc= hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=  the economy." 1.0
Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom= e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=  year ago. 1.0
Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=  million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. 1.0
Also include= d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim= e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at= tacks. 1.0
Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income = would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y= ear. 1.0
TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven= ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a = 28 percent fall in travel sales. 0.0
These declines reflect a substantial decre= ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc= e September 11th. 1.0
Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte= r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs= et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. 1.0
Net finance ch= arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie= lds. 0.0
This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd= uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter= . 1.0
The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of = higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque= ncies. 1.0
Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa= in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. 0.0
Operating=  expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine= ss volumes. 0.0
These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer= ing and cost-control efforts. 1.0
The above discussion presents TRS results "= on a managed basis" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh= ich conforms to industry practice. 1.0
The attached financials present TRS resu= lts on both a managed and reported basis. 1.0
Net income is the same in both fo= rmats. 0.0
On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=  $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m= illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. 1.0
The= se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=  therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses. 1.0
Americ= an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 = million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=  Net revenues decreased 14 percent. 1.0
Included in third quarter results are $= 62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note= d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim= s directly related to September 11th. 1.0
Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc= ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year. 1.0
AEFA re= sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on = the investment portfolio. 0.0
The weakened equity markets led to significantly = lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. 0.0
As a result, man= agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent. 0.0
Operating expenses, exclud= ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=  primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-= control initiatives. 1.0
As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=  company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit= ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. 1.0
The reduct= ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo= lio and concentrate on stronger credits. 1.0
American Express Bank (AEB) repo= rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i= ncome a year ago. 1.0
Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=  ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. 1.0
Excludi= ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate= ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year. 1.0
While AEB s= ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks= , the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. 1.0
Consequently, these co= sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results. 1.0
AEB's business results reflec= t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. 0.0
Re= sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses = as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. 0.0
These were offset in part by hi= gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b= alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues = to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. 1.0
Co= rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m= illion a year ago. 1.0

 Phillip,  Which one should I do, the 8x12 is half the price. 1.0
We pretty much make whatever you  would like to the specifications that you prefer. 0.0
All of our buildings are  durable and solidly constructed. 0.0
We build them in our shop and the ownner  is rersponsible for their delivery. 0.0
There is no labor cost so you are only  charged for the materials. 0.0
Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . 0.0
This is the most  economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a  given site. 1.0
This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar  style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. 1.0
We have  usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2" wide door opening. 0.0
I would think that  would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your  dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold  over 30 of these in the past ten years. 1.0
The price on this shed usually  varies between $800 and $900. 0.0
Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is  a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive. 1.0
It has vinyl siding and aluminum  soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe  Pronschinske. 1.0
This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize  and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it. 1.0
Your  dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though. 0.0
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door. 1.0
We are presently  building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up  door. 1.0
The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be  roughly $1500. 0.0
We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your  needs. 0.0
With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the  easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday  October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to  finish that one on time. 1.0
If you have any questions just e-mail me or call: 	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364 	My Home number 715-985-3063. 0.0
Have a good one and take with you later. 0.0

*******************
 Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures. 0.0
No hand-outs were provided. 0.0
Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock  540 mmcf/d Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d Needles 800 mmcf/d Wheeler 800 mmcf/d  New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d Both will be available around Feb 1  Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system. 1.0
Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations. 1.0
New Calculation, Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance. 0.0
SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points. 0.0
Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select. 0.0
Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts. 1.0
Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections. 0.0
Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast. 0.0
They use Weather Bank as one of their tools. 0.0
OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select  Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well. 1.0
Lots of complaints. 0.0
People were complaining that it restricted access to the system. 0.0
Eliminating point specific calculation. 0.0
Open system to Max Oper. 0.0
Limits or Contractual Limits. 0.0
Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures. 0.0
No changes to Wheeler Ridge. 0.0
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle. 1.0
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes. 0.0
If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows. 1.0
Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 . 0.0
No direct dial-up. 0.0
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party. 1.0
However, can still make  changes. 0.0
Can still upload new files. 1.0
2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO. 1.0
Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers. 1.0
Gas Select is official notification. 0.0
Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail. 0.0
Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free. 0.0
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific. 0.0
OFO's can be declared intraday. 0.0
Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day. 1.0
Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on. 0.0
Don't want to go back and forth. 1.0
This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works. 0.0
Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned. 1.0
Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage. 0.0
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week. 1.0
Can revise expected usage. 1.0
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO. 0.0
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy. 1.0
Generators need to revise expected usage. 0.0
Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal. 0.0
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4. 0.0
Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed. 1.0
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules. 1.0
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised. 0.0
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:  Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized. 1.0
Will allocate prorata. 0.0
Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point. 0.0
In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. 0.0
Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. 0.0
For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered. 1.0
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week. 1.0
Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume. 1.0
For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes. 1.0
For example:           Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4  In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th. 1.0
; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th. 1.0
Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes. 0.0

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). 1.0
Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. 1.0
This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt  In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. 1.0
doc  	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase: ? 1.0
Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role) ? 1.0
Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report) ? 1.0
Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)  Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 1.0
Issue: Do we agree to this condition. 0.0
I recommend we agree. 0.0
Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. 1.0

 Greetings Phillip,  I received your phone message. 0.0
Thanks for the update. 0.0
I have been talking with contractors and Spring Valley. 0.0
At this point we are trying to determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable. 1.0
Heather probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home to get a firm bid on the project. 0.0
I spoke today with the Spring Valley building consultant and faxed him some detail. 1.0
There are a couple of possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance from the decision makers when the time comes. 0.0
In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers disclosure forms from the website you found. 1.0
We are waiting on the final word from Spring Valley to move ahead. 0.0
I'll let you know when we have some new information. 0.0
I will get you a copy tomorrow. 1.0
Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of the contracts we need. 1.0
The website is below. 0.0
I believe the relevant contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form #OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition). 0.0
A coworker is about to close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used. 1.0
I would like to see if we'll have any easement  problems      above or around the garage area to consider. 0.0
If you find something and it's faxable, please send  it to my fax at      281-858-1127. 1.0
Feel free to call first if you have any  comments. 0.0

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. 0.0

This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. 1.0

  Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. 1.0
In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. 1.0
Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. 0.0
He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. 0.0
Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. 0.0
Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. 0.0
He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. 1.0
Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. 0.0
In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. 0.0
I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. 1.0
I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. 0.0
Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. 0.0
But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. 1.0
The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. 1.0

*******************
 Gentlemen  Good day. 0.0
I hope all is going well. 0.0
If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. 1.0
In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). 1.0
This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. 1.0
Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. 0.0
Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). 1.0
Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. 1.0
This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt  In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. 1.0
doc  	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase: ? 1.0
Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role) ? 1.0
Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report) ? 1.0
Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)  Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 1.0
Issue: Do we agree to this condition. 0.0
I recommend we agree. 0.0
Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. 1.0
I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 0.0
Thanks. 0.0
Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23. 0.0

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter. 0.0
Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? 1.0
Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season. 1.0
Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. 0.0
The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. 1.0
Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. 0.0
Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. 1.0
Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. 1.0
Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? 1.0
Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week. 1.0
Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. 1.0
One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. 0.0
Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. 0.0
The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. 0.0
Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 0.0
1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. 0.0
He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. 1.0
Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement. 1.0
Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. 0.0
Who should I start as my No. 1.0
2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? 1.0
Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. 1.0
It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. 1.0
Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. 1.0
In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. 1.0
Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. 1.0
Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. 0.0
Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. 0.0
Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. 1.0
And in divisional games, big players do well. 0.0
Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh. 1.0

(AND WHERE TO GET HELP IN A PINCH)      The week between Christmas and New Year's          is traditionally vacation time in Silicon          Valley, so we're taking the week off, too. 1.0
In the meantime, here are some places you can          get computer help over the holidays. 1.0
And if          you really, really miss me, I've also linked          to my most popular columns of 2001.  http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1224/2834324:8593142     PLUS: MY 2001 FAVORITES: PRODUCTS THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR ME   http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1224/2834332:8593142  #   _____________________NEWS ANALYSIS_____________________  Patrick Houston      HO, HO, HO! 1.0
WHY CHRISTMAS 2002 WILL BE JOLLY, BY GOLLY      While this is a muted Christmas for most     of us, it's been a merry one indeed for     e-tailers. 1.0
Pat thinks that if this holiday     generated so much holiday cheer, just     wait 'til next year. 1.0
That's when some     enabling technologies will make online     shopping far more than the glorified     catalog-buying experience it is now. 1.0

But so far it hasn't worked out that          well. 0.0
Reason: It's simply too costly. 0.0
But          is there some way your business can create          tailor-made goods for even broad markets? 1.0

Such an undertaking          would boost government spending and give          tech businesses a much-needed shot in the          arm. 1.0

 Welcome to Enron Center South. 0.0
As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. 0.0
We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 1.0
Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures. 1.0
NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover. 1.0
Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. 1.0
Turret Users An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication". 1.0
Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. 0.0
While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels. 1.0
The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment. 1.0
Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret. 0.0
The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret. 1.0
To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:   Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	 Weather Channel	12401	801	 CNN Headlines News	12402	802	 CNN Financial News	12403	803	 CNBC	12404	804	 MSNBC	12405	805	 Bloomberg	12406	806	 Financial News Network	12407	807	 CNN	12408	808	 Fox Sports	12409	809	 ESPN1	12410	810	   Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all. 1.0
We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move. 0.0
Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. 1.0
We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers. 0.0
Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. 1.0
The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing. 1.0
Updates will be provided as they become available. 0.0
Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com 1.0

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. 1.0
We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru." 0.0

Gridiron Guru   ? 1.0
Tip of the Week   	    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	       Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. 1.0
For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 1.0
29-30.) 0.0
If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. 1.0
Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 1.0
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season. 1.0
If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup. 1.0
Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. 1.0
The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. 0.0
If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production. 1.0
Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. 0.0
We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . 0.0
You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 0.0
Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 0.0
2 WR spot. 0.0
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten? 1.0
Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. 1.0
Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. 0.0
Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. 1.0
Go with Muhammad. 0.0
Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. 1.0
Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. 0.0
Who else should I start? 1.0
I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie. 0.0
Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. 1.0
Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. 1.0
We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. 0.0
Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 0.0
Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? 1.0
Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin? 1.0
Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. 0.0
Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. 0.0
As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. 0.0
You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. 0.0
George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore. 1.0
Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? 1.0
He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. 1.0
He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self. 0.0

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:      The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business school. 1.0
Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants. 1.0
While work experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially improve in a short period of time. 1.0
THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:      All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. 1.0

 Thanks. 0.0
That is an interesting idea. 1.0
I'd like to keep the rear stairway but that might still be possible. 0.0
Anyway, let's see what happens with the variance. 0.0
I appreciate your efforts. 0.0
By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors? 1.0
The hearing will be on January 8th. 1.0
In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the application had to be in by November 9th. 1.0
I was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline. 1.0
Sorry if I dropped the ball. 0.0
On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition. 1.0
It might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space. 0.0
You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room. 1.0
Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost. 1.0
Part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers. 1.0
This way you would not have to add a second staircase. 1.0
The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction. 1.0
In the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback. 1.0
Then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up. 0.0
>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition. 1.0
The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded. 0.0
That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing. 1.0
Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible. 0.0
Personally, I think opening the dining room would be the better idea. 1.0
I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exploring anything except your original plan. 0.0
But I wanted to suggest something in case the variance was not granted. 1.0
Let me know if you want me to try and sketch out these ideas. 0.0

 The prebid meeting is tomorrow from 3:00 to 5:00 in ECS 5075. 1.0
*******************
  I know that this is a difficult time for all of us. 1.0
With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year. 1.0
To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed. 0.0
Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season. 0.0
Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. 1.0
After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8. 1.0
Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event. 1.0
I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more. 1.0
We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season. 1.0

Tip of the Week   	    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	       Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. 0.0
Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. 1.0
Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. 1.0
Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week. 1.0

Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego? 1.0
Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. 1.0
The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. 1.0
Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. 0.0
But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. 0.0
He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. 1.0
Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas. 0.0
Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start? 1.0
I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst. 0.0
Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. 1.0
Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. 1.0
Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. 0.0
It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game. 1.0
Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? 1.0
I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. 0.0
The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. 0.0
and Seattle). 0.0
Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. 1.0
Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. 0.0
With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB. 0.0
Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. 0.0
I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. 1.0
Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander. 0.0

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis. 0.0
I don't know if this would be agreeable to you. 0.0
Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think. 0.0
If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections. 0.0
I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors. 0.0
We are torn between two good locations. 0.0
However, we are leaning towards Kerrville. 0.0
The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially. 0.0
We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos. 1.0
I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately. 1.0

 Pam,  Can you help with below? 1.0
Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan. 1.0
The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?". 1.0
This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution. 1.0
I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount. 0.0
I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1. 1.0
This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares. 1.0
Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 0.0
8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value. 0.0
This is the methodology described in Section 7.1. 1.0
Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns. 0.0
Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further. 1.0
Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. 1.0
A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. 1.0
Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. 0.0
This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. 1.0
The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. 1.0
Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan. 1.0

The  early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary wi= dely in degree. 0.0
As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become f= ar less  dramatic. 1.0
Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early b= ecause of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to = September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. 1.0
That's about average for rebounds = in  the postwar period. 1.0
As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this = week's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries fr= om the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won ba= ck an average of 33% of the  bear market loss. 1.0
In  each of the nine insta= nces, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two mo= nths and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six = months. 1.0
On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovere= d after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in=  a year. 1.0

  Phillip,   It will go along this lines: (Conservative)  ***************************************************** We pay "0" going forward We have already played 300K in 3Q2001 Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002  Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally  We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K  Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use. 0.0
This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture  Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales. 1.0
I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. 0.0
Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved. 0.0
***********************************************************************  If we do not reach the agreement: 1. 0.0
Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or 				 2. 1.0
Continue "as is" with payment differed for 90 days or merger. 1.0
We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate. 1.0
Any comments or suggestions? 1.0
Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact. 1.0
In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost. 0.0
(it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. 0.0
A total of two sims could be cut one. 0.0
Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting. 1.0
Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions. 0.0
I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 0.0
Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time. 0.0
We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses. 0.0
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow. 0.0
Is BRM "core" to the Enron for next few months or new organization? 1.0

 Phillip,  Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting:  1. 1.0
We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the Knowledge System layer. 0.0
We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type. 0.0
2. 0.0
You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content for these problems. 0.0
We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next week to gather content and a second meeting for review. 1.0
3. 0.0
We will change "Gas Daily Risk" to "Intra-Month Risk" throughout the simulation. 0.0
Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk? 1.0
4. 0.0
Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. 1.0
Is that what you had in mind too? 1.0
Thank you in advance for your help. 0.0
Have a great Thanksgiving. 1.0

 To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:  You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails). 0.0
We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP. 1.0
We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line. 1.0
We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). 0.0
This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. 1.0
After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. 0.0
Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen. 1.0
Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away. 1.0
To our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days). 1.0
This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information. 1.0
We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support). 1.0
Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. 0.0
Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message "You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset." 1.0
This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). 1.0
Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. 1.0
If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #. 1.0
2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). 1.0
Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. 1.0
Since we have released these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before). 1.0
Always remember that your password is case sensitive. 1.0
Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future. 0.0
Sincerely,  Howard Gordon Network Manager   - geninfo.vcf 0.0

We will still need all characters (and         talent) that we have casted for. 0.0
Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts. 1.0
We have recieved today (mid-day). 1.0
Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. 1.0
Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th. 1.0
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our scripts. 1.0

*******************
 For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a "single sum distribution," in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. 1.0
Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. 1.0
A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. 1.0
Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. 0.0
This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. 1.0
The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. 1.0
Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan. 1.0

 Wow! 0.0
this looks complicated. 0.0
=20  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. 1.0
This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. 1.0
It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. 1.0
In my case this would be as=  of September 30th. 1.0
I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=  of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. 0.0
The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. 1.0
Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. 1.0
Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. 1.0
There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. 0.0
First,=   section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. 1.0
Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. 0.0
The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. 1.0
If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. 1.0
This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. 1.0
However, it states "The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=   This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=  share in the account on January 1, 2001. 1.0
Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. 1.0

 Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG. 0.0
Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 1.0
Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. 1.0
I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. 0.0

 Ina,   Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance  reviews from H.R. 1.0
*******************
I  have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year. 1.0
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the  distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for  power quality reasons. 0.0
The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due  to server farms and technology companies. 1.0
There is a 100 MW server farm  trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months  due to distribution infrastructure issues. 1.0
Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years. 1.0
The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms. 1.0
Fast-forward to summer 2000. 1.0
Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. 0.0
Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com. 0.0
Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle. 0.0
More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy. 1.0
It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites. 1.0
Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities. 0.0
"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. 0.0
"That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries." 1.0
A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads. 1.0
Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. 1.0
The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. 0.0
Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said. 1.0
Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 0.0
For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue. 1.0
On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. 0.0
The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. 1.0
On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures. 0.0
Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate. 1.0
"These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads," said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light. 1.0
"The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 0.0
We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts." 1.0
With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. 0.0
Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. 1.0
In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies. 1.0
"It is probably the largest data center park in the  country," boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. 0.0
Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park. 1.0
After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. 0.0
Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country. 1.0
As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate. 0.0
But it is not just Seattle. 0.0
The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California. 0.0
Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 1.0
While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management. 0.0
"We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle. 1.0
The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed. 0.0
"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. 0.0
"The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way." 1.0

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. 1.0
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. 1.0
This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. 1.0
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. 1.0
As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. 1.0
Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. 0.0
I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. 1.0
Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. 1.0
The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. 1.0
Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. 1.0
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. 1.0
We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. 0.0
Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. 1.0
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. 1.0
This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. 1.0
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. 1.0
As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. 0.0
I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. 1.0
You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. 0.0
Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. 0.0
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. 1.0

My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. 1.0
I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. 1.0
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. 1.0
A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. 0.0
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. 1.0
The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. 1.0
The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. 1.0
Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency. 1.0
She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. 1.0
There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. 1.0
Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. 0.0

*******************
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. 1.0
This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. 1.0
(I thought his sales price was $187,000.) 0.0
At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. 0.0
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability. 1.0
You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. 0.0
As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. 0.0
In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. 1.0

The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling. 0.0
At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction. 1.0
I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way. 0.0
The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date. 1.0
Let me know what you think. 0.0
I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek. 0.0
I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property. 1.0

*******************
As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. 1.0
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. 1.0
This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. 1.0
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. 1.0
As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. 1.0
Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. 0.0
I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. 1.0
Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. 1.0
The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. 1.0
Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. 1.0
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. 1.0
We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. 0.0
Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. 1.0
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. 1.0
This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. 1.0
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. 1.0
As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. 0.0
I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. 1.0
You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. 0.0
Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. 0.0
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. 1.0
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. 0.0
Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. 1.0
You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. 1.0
My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. 1.0
I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. 1.0
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. 1.0
A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. 0.0
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. 1.0
The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. 1.0
The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. 1.0
Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency. 1.0
She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. 1.0
There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. 1.0
Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. 0.0

Is the closing today?? 1.0
After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding  as far as I can determine.? 1.0
It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like  anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate  closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 1.0
? 1.0
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 1.0

I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and  find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can. 0.0
? 1.0
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable  document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 1.0
This isn't either.? 1.0

atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 1.0

*******************
 here is the file I showed you. 1.0
*******************
The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. 1.0
LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. 1.0
Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. 0.0
If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced. 0.0
All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0
Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. 0.0
PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. 0.0
I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. 1.0
Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. 0.0

 Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index. 1.0
A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. 1.0
At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation. 0.0
Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. 1.0
We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27. 0.0
These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). 1.0
Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary. 1.0
We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships. 1.0
The two key points from this data are as follows:   1. 0.0
The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 1.0
2. 0.0
The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily. 1.0
It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different. 1.0
I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. 1.0
Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers. 1.0
I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index. 0.0
It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index. 1.0
It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business. 0.0
Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal. 1.0

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. 1.0
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. 0.0
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? 1.0
San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. 1.0
The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. 1.0
Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. 0.0
This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. 1.0
If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. 1.0
The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. 1.0

*******************
The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. 1.0
LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. 1.0
Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. 0.0
If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced. 0.0
All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0
Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. 0.0
PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. 0.0

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%. 0.0
This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. 1.0
Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high. 0.0
Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF. 1.0
It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. 0.0

But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third consecutive day. 1.0
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. 0.0
But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. 1.0
But that still wasn't enough juice. 0.0
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/MWh. 1.0
The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. 1.0
It is free sell power instate above the $250/MWh price cap. 0.0
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. 1.0
The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. 0.0
However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. 1.0
The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. 1.0
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. 0.0
But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. 1.0
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. 1.0
The ISO is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. 1.0
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. 1.0
A stage three is declared when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. 0.0
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. 0.0
"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation," Dorinson said. 0.0
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. 1.0
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. 0.0
The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. 1.0
It's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. 0.0

The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. 1.0
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. 1.0
The ISO manages grid reliability. 1.0
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. 1.0
However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. 1.0
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). 1.0
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said. 1.0

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. 1.0
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. 1.0
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. 1.0
The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. 1.0
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. 1.0
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. 1.0
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. 1.0
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection. 1.0
AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits  The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. 0.0
They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. 1.0
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. 0.0
The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. 0.0
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. 1.0
"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it," Thomas said. 0.0
"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality district's" authority. 1.0
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so. 1.0
Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. 1.0
"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. 1.0
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. 1.0
"We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said. 0.0
"We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited." 0.0
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. 1.0

 Folks,  I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I think will be interesting to the group. 0.0
I highly recommend David Moore's book "The Roman Pantheon" at $25.00  -   a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. 0.0
The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. 1.0
I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. 0.0
David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. 1.0
A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks. 0.0
Thank you, Mr. Moore. 0.0
I highly recommend the site and especially the Book. 0.0

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth. 1.0
According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths, this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our Master of Lime, 'Arry . 1.0

 Steve,   I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. 0.0
If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. 0.0
As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1. 0.0
Examine LDC's incentive rate program. 0.0
Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost. 1.0
The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. 1.0
This creates a shortage in later months. 1.0
2. 0.0
California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand. 0.0
Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. 0.0
Specific questions should include:      1. 0.0
Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage? 1.0
2. 0.0
Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system. 1.0
I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand. 0.0
They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less. 0.0
3. 0.0
Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices. 0.0
Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs. 0.0
By design the customers are short at a floating  rate. 1.0
This market has been long historically. 0.0

 Jim,   I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I  described to you last week. 1.0
The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in  San Marcos. 1.0
There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a  couple of other investors involved. 0.0
As I mentioned last week, I would like  to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not  require the investors to personally guarantee. 1.0
If there is a creative way to  structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. 0.0
One idea that has  been mentioned is to obtain a "forward commitment" in order to reduce the  equity required. 1.0
I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this  nature are normally financed. 0.0
Specifically, the transition from interim to  permanent financing. 0.0
I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be  important to banks. 0.0
I am faxing you a project summary. 0.0

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself. 0.0
The gov. 0.0
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas. 1.0
He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. 1.0
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared. 1.0
Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. 1.0
The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. 1.0
His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. 1.0
He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level. 0.0
He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW). 1.0
He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. 1.0
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided). 1.0
He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. 1.0
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases. 1.0
As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. 1.0
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". 1.0
Some of these ideas would require legislative action. 1.0
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of  generation plants. 0.0
The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. 1.0
This  was a frequently recurring theme. 0.0
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. 1.0
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. 0.0
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. 0.0
Expand in-state gas production. 0.0
Take state lands gas royalties in kind. 0.0
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. 0.0
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. 1.0
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. 0.0
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). 0.0
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. 0.0
We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. 0.0
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. 0.0
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. 1.0
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. 0.0
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. 0.0
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. 0.0
Thanks to everyone for their help. 0.0
We made some progress today. 1.0

I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes. 1.0
If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor. 1.0
Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. 1.0
This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. 1.0
I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so  I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. 1.0

 By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15  As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile  Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas  storage number. 1.0
The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the  forecast was for frigid weather. 1.0
Traders put the two together, anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 0.0
"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson,  a trader. 0.0
"It makes the market for natural gas." 0.0
But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas  Association's director of gas supply and transportation. 0.0
He had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality. 1.0
"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what  we are reporting," McGill said. 0.0
As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --  and culprits -- is on. 0.0
Some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at Wall Street. 0.0
Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for  the rise in gas prices. 0.0
"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik  told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 1.0
In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 0.0
Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes. 1.0
Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take  precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price  insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared. 1.0
"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul  Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 0.0
But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 1.0
"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to  change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security  Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 1.0
Hot topic   Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. 0.0
In  many circles, little else is discussed. 0.0
The Rev. 0.0
Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is  facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the  previous December's bill. 1.0
Church members are suffering from higher bills as  well. 0.0
The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of  his salary. 1.0
For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 1.0
"It's the talk of the town here," he said. 0.0
A year ago that wasn't a fear. 1.0
Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per  thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile  to drill for gas. 1.0
Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers. 1.0
But trouble was brewing. 0.0
By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand  cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter. 0.0
There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. 0.0
By early November,  prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. 0.0
The federal Energy Information  Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 1.0
But $10 gas was coming. 0.0
Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,  including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets. 0.0
"It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 0.0
Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York  traders. 0.0
Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile  commodity in the world. 0.0
Setting the price   In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas, allowing it to float. 1.0
In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices. 1.0
The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years. 1.0
Suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce. 1.0
And big gas consumers, from  utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use. 1.0
There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas. 0.0
But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to  know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. 1.0
Like all  futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. 1.0
That leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time. 1.0
As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than $7 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 1.0
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's  weekly storage numbers. 1.0
Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter. 1.0
Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in  hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 1.0
Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient. 1.0
But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 0.0
Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994. 1.0
Still, said the  association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 0.0
But some utility executives didn't share that view. 1.0
William Eliason, vice  president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had  continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 1.0

 Patti,  This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps  in scheduling. 1.0
Remember their rotations last for one year. 1.0
Do you want to  be an interviewer? 1.0
While we anticipate many new Analysts  joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it  necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting  event. 1.0
We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting  approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed. 0.0
I am asking that you forward  this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above). 0.0
We will conduct  first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the  afternoon. 1.0
We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning  (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session. 1.0
Please submit your  response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date. 1.0
In  addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking  one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer. 1.0

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially  complete. 0.0
PG&E is OK with the docs. 0.0
All QFs but Calpine have agreed with  the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would "retain" $106 million (of  what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who  switched to PX pricing). 0.0
The money would come from changing the basis for the  QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December  (and maybe earlier). 1.0
PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the  Force Majeure notices off the table. 0.0
QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get  some assurances of payment. 0.0
SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due  on 2/2/01. 0.0
For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's  purchases from such QFs. 0.0
Two people are negotiating the these agreements  (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. 0.0

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation. 1.0
At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. 1.0
Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. 0.0
However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract. 0.0
Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1. 1.0
Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. 0.0
Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 0.0
2. 0.0
+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45. 0.0
I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon. 0.0

*******************
Cash Needs Highlights: SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. 0.0
Since then SCE has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20 available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. 1.0
The actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. 0.0
II. 0.0
Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. 0.0
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. 0.0
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. 1.0
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. 0.0
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. 1.0
III. 0.0
Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. 1.0
Under=  such=20 scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. 0.0
IV. 0.0
Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. 1.0
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. 1.0
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. 0.0
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. 0.0
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20 Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20 Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. 0.0
This=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. 1.0
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s= =20 Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. 0.0
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th= e=20 end of each year. 1.0
However, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20 D.01-01-018. 0.0
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the TCBA. 0.0
Because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the TRA, are overstated. 0.0
TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU= RN=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. 1.0
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. 0.0
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=  the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the TRA is overstated. 1.0

Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. 1.0
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. 0.0
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. 1.0

I have shifted  to a slightly different plan. 0.0
There were too many design items that I could  not work out in the plan we discussed previously. 1.0
Now, I am leaning more  towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. 1.0
One  wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3  kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. 0.0
The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. 0.0
This  plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the  courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor  living. 1.0
I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 1.0
The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass  skylights supported by metal posts. 1.0

I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet  but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. 1.0
As Gary and Wade  continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the  property's tenants and reputation. 0.0
The apartments are looking better and  better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. 1.0
Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. 1.0

I  realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and  your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be  working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running  an errand for the property. 1.0
I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this  time. 1.0
We can look at again later in the year. 1.0

 Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. 1.0

Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns. 0.0

 Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. 1.0
Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. 0.0
This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer. 1.0
After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash. 0.0
You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email. 1.0
Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. 1.0

 Jacques,  Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? 1.0
The key business points are:  1. 0.0
Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2. 0.0
Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3. 0.0
The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 0.0
4. 0.0
All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 1.0
5. 0.0

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs. 0.0
Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. 0.0

 Lucy,  Here is the rentroll for this Friday. 0.0
Sorry it is so late. 0.0
There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 0.0
1. 0.0
I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. 0.0
The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 1.0
2. 0.0
#1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 1.0
3. 0.0
#3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 1.0

8. 0.0
#20a missed on 2/2? 1.0
9. 0.0
#35 missed on 2/2? 1.0
My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. 1.0
You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on  some of these. 0.0

 George,  I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. 0.0
I still have the  concerns that I had last week. 1.0
Specifically that the costs of our project  are too high. 0.0
I have gathered more information that support my concerns. 1.0
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5  million. 0.0
The components are as follows:   Unit Cost, Site work, &  builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million   Land      1.15   Interim Financing     .85   Common Areas       .80   Total     $10.4  Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to  get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. 1.0
Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A  properties. 1.0
It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce  the same rent or sales price. 0.0
There should adjustments for location and the  seasonal nature of student rental property. 0.0
I recognize that Sagewood is  currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to  the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market  will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. 1.0
Supply will inevitablely  increase to drive this market more in balance. 0.0
After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost  estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. 1.0
He  feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. 0.0
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. 0.0
Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we  cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. 0.0
We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives. 1.0

*******************
Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. 1.0
There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction. 1.0
First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. 0.0
We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. 1.0
Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project. 1.0
We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000. 1.0
I have summarized our issues as follows:  1. 0.0
Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2. 0.0
Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over. 0.0
3. 0.0
A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI). 0.0
4. 0.0
Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. 0.0
of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate. 1.0
5. 0.0
The debt service will be approx. 0.0
$874,000/year. 0.0
6. 0.0
Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:       Land -                   $1,121,670      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000      Cash Equity              $1,419,268      Total                    $2,955,938  7. 1.0
Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage  of actual hard construction costs. 0.0

Phillip Allen  Keith Holst  ENRON  1400 Smith Street  Houston, TX? 1.0
77002-7361  Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout  Dear Phillip and Keith:   We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash  expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of  all note obligations and design contracts.? 1.0
As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and  existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company,  and appraisal total $67,050.? 1.0
The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which  current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. 1.0
Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this  project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design  and other pre-construction elements.? 1.0
As it is a major project for a firm of  our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or  rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 1.0
Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a  percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on  your prior valuation of our time.? 1.0
For the first, we feel that at least 25%,  or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? 1.0
For the  second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per  year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? 1.0
Either of these  valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the  forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. 1.0
?However, in  the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future  projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per  month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? 1.0
As shown in the  attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings  the total net buyout to $78,946.? 1.0
We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? 1.0
However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 1.0
If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? 1.0
The attorneys can then  draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the  Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout  amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. 1.0

 Gentlemen,  Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to  date. 1.0
I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. 0.0
The property is  still in two parcels. 1.0
Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot  and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. 0.0
He has also completed a  topographical survey and a tree survey. 0.0
In addition, he has begun to  coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the  smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. 0.0
Hugo is going  to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to  complete. 1.0
The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which  $14,000 are due now for work completed. 1.0
We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by  the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. 0.0
If we can  continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. 0.0
Hugo's  number is 512-295-8052. 0.0
I thought you might want to contact him directly and  ask him some questions. 0.0
I spoke to him about the possibility of your call  and he was fine with that. 0.0

 Laird,   Did you meet with SWG on April 27th. 1.0
Are there any other asset management  targets in the west? 1.0
We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management. 1.0
In preparation for that meeting we would like to  gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.   Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are  typical quantities and term on sales? 1.0
Are there any services we provide? 1.0
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? 1.0
Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas? 1.0
We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets. 0.0
For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions. 0.0
This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like. 1.0
Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. 1.0
That  risk may not be acceptable to the desk. 0.0
I will do some investigation of  their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity. 0.0
As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure? 1.0
Are  there elements that you would like to see? 1.0
Any ideas at all would be greatly  appreciated. 0.0
Thanks,  Laird 0.0

 Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. 0.0
Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? 1.0
What role would you play in obtaining financing? 1.0
Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans? 1.0
Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet. 1.0
I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. 0.0
I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. 0.0
As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. 1.0
I am not thrilled about  such a low return. 0.0
I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. 1.0
Any ideas? 1.0
I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you  local connections. 0.0
I am not discounting those services. 0.0

*******************
Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct. 1.0
At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%. 1.0
This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year. 1.0
Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to "forced" reductions via rolling blackouts). 1.0
Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June. 0.0
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. 1.0
Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year. 1.0
This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug. 1.0
In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. 1.0
Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. 0.0
Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load. 1.0
I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand. 0.0
As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. 1.0
As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish). 1.0
This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC. 1.0
Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production. 0.0
I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. 1.0
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. 0.0
While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer. 1.0
This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer. 1.0
I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available. 0.0
Meantime, I  hope this helps. 0.0

 Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday. 0.0
I left feeling very optimistic  about the panel system. 0.0
I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels  into the home design I showed you. 1.0
In order to make it feasible within my  budget I am sure it will take several iterations. 1.0
The prospect of purchasing  the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered. 0.0
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor. 0.0
I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this  product with very little probability of a sale. 0.0
I just want to assure you  that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously  consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in  cost over stick built. 0.0
Please email your cost estimates when complete. 1.0
Thank you,  Phillip Allen 0.0

*******************
Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap. 1.0
I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. 1.0
Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position. 1.0
Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda. 1.0
Hope this info helps. 0.0

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline. 1.0
Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart. 0.0
According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. 0.0
The Democratic caucus is  reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis. 0.0
Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into  the fund. 0.0
Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor. 0.0
However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. 1.0
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. 1.0
If not, the state may be in breach of  contract. 1.0
Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult. 1.0
The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion. 1.0
However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession. 0.0
Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward. 1.0
Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X. 0.0
AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. 0.0
This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support. 0.0
AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts. 0.0
However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X. 1.0
Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 1.0
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund. 0.0
For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued. 0.0
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds. 0.0
The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday. 0.0
Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. 0.0
Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority. 1.0
The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward. 1.0
Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations. 1.0
Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support. 1.0
No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power. 1.0
Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. 0.0
for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. 0.0
However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis. 1.0
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. 0.0
The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor. 0.0
The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. 1.0
According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it. 1.0
The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. 1.0
If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. 1.0
The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount. 1.0
In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities. 0.0
If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy. 1.0
SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments. 0.0

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide. 1.0

as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future. 0.0
Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019. 0.0
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.) 1.0
Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 0.0
139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate. 0.0
Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections. 1.0
Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. 1.0
What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. 1.0
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. 0.0
In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. 1.0
Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. 1.0
There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it. 1.0

*******************
The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. 1.0
For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice. 0.0
I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between "scheduled" and "actual"  generation. 0.0
You are pulling "scheduled." 0.0
If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that. 0.0
You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. 0.0
That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. 0.0
Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side. 0.0
On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. 1.0
While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the "scheduled" number. 0.0
The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. 1.0
I think the presentation looks good. 0.0
It would be useful to share this with  others up here once you have it finished. 0.0
I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption. 0.0

 The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO. 1.0
Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. 1.0
The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-  (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	 	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. 1.0
The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. 1.0
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen  	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. 1.0
I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. 0.0
(iv)	Due Diligence 	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). 1.0
Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. 1.0
I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis. 1.0
Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. 0.0
Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are. 1.0
I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this. 0.0
I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. 1.0
If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. 1.0
Happy New Year  Louise 0.0

 Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. 1.0
I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. 0.0
You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. 0.0
that sounds like a lot. 1.0
I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. 0.0
Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. 0.0
If your budget is $85-90 per sq. 1.0
ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management. 1.0

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. 0.0
I already have my blueprints completed. 0.0
What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof. 1.0
I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. 1.0
The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. 1.0
I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. 0.0
I was wondering about alternatives. 0.0
Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. 1.0
For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. 0.0
He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. 0.0
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. 1.0
But would the foam insulation be as effective? 1.0
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. 1.0
I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. 0.0
Thank you for your help. 0.0

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. 1.0
John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups. 1.0

 Phillip,  This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event. 1.0
The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent. 1.0
As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent. 1.0
We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares). 1.0
If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares. 0.0
Please let me know you preference. 0.0
As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt. 0.0
As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files. 0.0
He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments. 0.0
If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology. 0.0
Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you. 1.0
It is clear that the payment will be made in shares. 1.0
However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares. 1.0
The plan document under VII. 0.0
Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock." 0.0
Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account. 1.0
Thank you,  Phillip Allen 0.0

You will then be directed to a screen that asks for information such as: Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire. 1.0

You can change your account descriptions by clicking on the Nicknames button and entering your own account description. 0.0
We are still working on getting the information to post again correctly (your old account information has been removed, and we hope to have this information converted shortly and back on-line), so you will notice that credits and debits do not show up in the appropriate columns. 1.0

*******************
 To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there:  We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to your questions. 1.0
The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message "You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset." 1.0
This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone). 1.0
Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. 1.0
If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #. 1.0
2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). 1.0
Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. 1.0
3)  If you see this error message "Invalid login; please try again" (after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last category. 1.0
Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly (we will not release any information about these accounts until we verify that all information is correct and accurate). 1.0
We are finalizing these accounts today and should have them available for access this afternoon (late) or this evening. 1.0
Once we release these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before). 1.0
Always remember that your password is case sensitive. 1.0
Should you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and transactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night). 1.0
We will have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then information will be as of Monday (11/19/01). 1.0
Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to continuing to service your IBS needs in the future. 1.0

 Phillip Good Morning! 0.0
I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family and safe travels. 1.0
As per our meeting on Tuesday, please identify people you think will be good for the expert story roles. 1.0
You can provide me a list and either contact them first or provide me with an introduction to get their commitment. 0.0
Thanks a million in advance for your continued support of this project. 0.0
Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of producint the expert stories for our simulation. 1.0
I understand you will be obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories. 0.0
Thank you for your help. 0.0
Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:  Number of SMEs needed:  10 Number of expert stories: 20-25 Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a mix of structurers, originators and traders   I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories. 0.0
The main difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of 11/30. 0.0
By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with them for the following week. 1.0
I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday. 1.0
(11/26-11/28)                          --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs (11/28-11/30)                          --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot. 0.0
(12/3-12/6)                --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we need and where they can provide stories. 1.0
--Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the stories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video shoot. 0.0
--Make changes to stories, if necessary. 0.0
--Send final stories and video shoot logistics to SMEs (12/10-12/12)                           --Video shoot  Please let me know if you have any questions. 1.0

 Michelle Here are my very minor comments. 0.0
However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. 1.0
One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. 0.0
Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? 1.0
In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? 1.0
(i.e. 0.0
So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. 0.0

Sheri  When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. 0.0
Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a "Dateline" type theme for one, and a "60 Minute" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. 0.0
In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. 1.0
title change to manager)? 1.0
Here are the remaining scripts. 1.0
Tim and I will review them too and forward our comments to you. 0.0
Any feedback on the first two scripts? 1.0
Again, Thanks!! 0.0
Your comments were incorporated in the scripts for scenarios 1 and 2. 1.0
We decided to refer to the company as both Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. 0.0
so that there is no confusion with Enron International. 0.0
We will not have a coach exit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting. 1.0
In reference to your concern over "locking in a price" as collusion, those were Phillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them. 1.0
Please let me know if you have any questions. 1.0

 Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. 0.0
With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. 1.0
And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. 1.0
These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out. 1.0
I have added another post office for your consideration. 0.0
It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. 0.0
The flyer is attached. 0.0
In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. 0.0
Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. 1.0

 Wow! 0.0
this looks complicated. 0.0
=20  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. 1.0
This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. 1.0
It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. 1.0
In my case this would be as=  of September 30th. 1.0
I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=  of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. 0.0
The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. 1.0
Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. 1.0
Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. 1.0
There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. 0.0
First,=   section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. 1.0
Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. 0.0
The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. 1.0
If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. 1.0
This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. 1.0
However, it states "The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=   This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=  share in the account on January 1, 2001. 1.0
Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. 1.0
The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=  distribution under each of the three interpretations:     Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1  Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar= es Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13 Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658 10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10 Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares  I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair. 0.0
If the = administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7= .1 should apply. 1.0
The current interpretation of the plan administrators is = a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. 1.0
=  =20  In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=  same issue. 0.0
I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt= er. 0.0

*******************
 For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a "single sum distribution," in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. 1.0
Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. 1.0
A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. 1.0
Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. 0.0
This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. 1.0
The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. 1.0
Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan. 1.0

 To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:  You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails). 0.0
We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP. 1.0
We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line. 1.0
We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). 0.0
This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. 1.0
After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. 0.0
Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen. 1.0
Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away. 1.0
To our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days). 1.0
This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information. 1.0
We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support). 1.0
Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. 0.0
Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message "You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset." 1.0
This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). 1.0
Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. 1.0
If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #. 1.0
2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). 1.0
Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. 1.0

"There was nothing going on in Florida today," said one southern energy trader. 1.0
"Everything was going to markets in the north." 0.0

"Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out," said on Entergy power trader. 0.0
"Prices, declined to $60 and less." 0.0
The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. 0.0
Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates. 0.0
Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region. 1.0
In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices. 0.0
"The cold weather's backing off," said one SPP utility trader. 0.0
"It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill. 1.0
Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold." 1.0

Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday. 0.0
-Brian Whary    U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand       London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. 1.0
The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour. 0.0
Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.      Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. 1.0
December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. 1.0
December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade. 1.0
First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said. 1.0
January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence. 1.0
First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close. 1.0

Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour. 1.0
Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. 0.0
Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed. 1.0
-Nick Livingstone   Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast       Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. 1.0
Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. 1.0
Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. 1.0
Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. 1.0
These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing. 0.0
Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating. 0.0
Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said. 1.0
"The market's been waiting for this day for a long time," a Stockholm-based trader said. 1.0
"For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. 1.0
We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price." 0.0
Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. 1.0
The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling. 1.0
Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. 1.0
Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. 0.0
Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week. 1.0
Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts. 1.0
Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. 1.0
Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said. 1.0
Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. 1.0
Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. 1.0

 Jeff,  I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter. 0.0
Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now. 1.0
I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release. 0.0
I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday. 1.0
The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week. 1.0
Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs. 0.0
Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected. 1.0
The utilities are already in her name. 1.0
In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip. 1.0
Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release. 0.0
Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes. 0.0
I expect to have that done by Friday. 1.0
I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday. 1.0
As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand. 1.0
I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership. 0.0
However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownership interests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes. 1.0
(per her attorneys advice). 0.0
She is ready to sign the settlement, but she has not been able to talk to her lawyer who is tied up in court. 0.0
I have attached a Word file with the a letter to them which authorizes the transfer. 1.0
If it is acceptable please sign and fax to her directly at 830-372-5400. 0.0

 Jeff,  Here is a short letter that indicates I will give consent contingent to the items we discussed. 1.0
I didn't make any reference to why I took the utilities out of my name. 0.0
I left that for you to explain to her that we need to have a cutoff date so we can calculate the final amount. 0.0
I hope you can make her understand that I have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time. 0.0
Since my attorney is out of town until Monday and I doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership (certainly not the 1st lienholders consent) we will have to work together next week. 1.0

 Carlos,  Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions? 1.0
I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly. 0.0
Here is my situation. 0.0
I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago. 1.0
I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th. 1.0
I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000. 0.0
See calculations below:  Sales price:		2,100,000 Purchase price		1,200,000 Fees&Devel costs	  500,000  Profit			 400,000  The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan. 1.0
I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange. 1.0
I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. 0.0
First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago. 1.0
I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project. 1.0
We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me. 0.0
The loan still exist. 0.0
I am an 80% limited partner. 0.0
Another investor is the other limited partner. 1.0
We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner. 0.0
We intend to develop the property. 0.0
Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange? 1.0
Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000. 0.0
I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing. 0.0
I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP. 1.0
If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property. 1.0
My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name. 0.0
Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity? 1.0
Thank you in advance for your help. 0.0

 John,  Two items:  1. 0.0
I spoke to John McKay about Sumas. 0.0
His views seem well thought out. 0.0
He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st. 1.0
See attached spreadsheet. 0.0
In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10. 0.0
But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85. 1.0
Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40 	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. 1.0
See attached spreadsheet. 0.0
Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium. 1.0
In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book. 1.0
2. 0.0
I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues. 0.0
*******************
  Is there any chance that the request to gather data on financial trades is implemented? 1.0
Our understanding was that the commission had no jurisdiction over financial markets. 1.0
They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data. 1.0
El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market. 0.0
El Paso suggests the following information be collected: the name of the counter party to the financial trade the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates the date on which the deal was entered into the type of trade  El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.) 1.0
I have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically. 0.0
Let me know if you want a copy faxed. 0.0
*******************
  jeff,  Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market. 1.0
If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply? 1.0
If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time. 1.0
Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered. 1.0
As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis. 1.0
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron. 1.0
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). 1.0
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). 1.0
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market. 0.0
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. 0.0
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious). 1.0
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts. 1.0
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts. 1.0
Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. 0.0
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access. 1.0
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any "out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions. 1.0
(My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) 1.0
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts. 1.0
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights. 1.0
We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive. 1.0
We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT. 0.0
Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you. 1.0
Thanks, Jeff 0.0

Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir= ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid= ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of=  commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a= dditional acres of low density residential. 1.0
In addition, the total eight a= cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su= ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing=  development in the revised future land use plan. 1.0
The total 10 acres of co= mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to "community commerci= al" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens= ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit= h buffering and landscaping. 1.0
A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t= o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. 0.0
=  However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som= e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po= se on the busy state highway. 1.0
Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th= e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave= nue. 0.0
While the state highway department and city would have input into the=  plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron=  Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between=  the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford. 0.0
Council member Jane Hughso= n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect= or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th= e area as development proceeds. 1.0
"I'd rather say "no' and if someone comes = us with a really good idea, look at it then," Hughson said. 0.0
Councilman Ed = Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th= e curb cut. 0.0
"It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe= n there," Mihalkanin said. 0.0
A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud= e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San = Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting = against the move. 1.0
Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the=  meeting. 0.0
Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa= l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good = compromise. 1.0
Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit= ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin= g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests = of the city as a whole. 1.0
"This is not a victory for one side or the other,"=  said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to=  Weatherford's initial plans for his property, "but a victory for the City = of San Marcos. 1.0

The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions. 1.0
The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. 1.0
The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. 1.0
The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations. 1.0
The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. 1.0
The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists. 1.0
``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company. 1.0
Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687. 0.0

 Barry,  Mike and I are going to meet with John L. at 2:30 to officially work out the details of Mike's succession as desk head. 0.0
We will probably announce to the group by the end of the week. 1.0
There is nothing for you to do, just keeping us informed.. 0.0
This is a large deal being led  by the Gulf orig team. 1.0
that may have some rockies production transactions included in them. 1.0
We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. 0.0
Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. 1.0
For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. 1.0
Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. 1.0
The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. 1.0
Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. 0.0
We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. 0.0
OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. 0.0
North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. 0.0
In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. 0.0
They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration. 0.0
Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. 0.0
They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. 0.0
The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. 0.0
In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. 0.0
This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. 1.0
Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages. 0.0
The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. 0.0
Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. 1.0

 10:30 (Dow Jones) The key to analyzing media stocks is....automobiles? 1.0
Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. 0.0
Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. 1.0
By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies "to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports." 1.0
Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). 1.0

 David,  For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3. 1.0
Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan. 1.0
The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?". 1.0
This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution. 1.0
I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount. 0.0
I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1. 1.0
This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares. 1.0
Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 0.0
8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value. 0.0
This is the methodology described in Section 7.1. 1.0
Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns. 0.0
Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further. 1.0
Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. 1.0
A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. 1.0
Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. 0.0
This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. 1.0
The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. 1.0
Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan. 1.0

 Greg,  This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit. 1.0

Here is a list of questions:  1. 0.0
Unit mixes of all proposed projects. 1.0
2. 0.0
Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. 0.0
(186) 3. 0.0
Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds? 1.0
This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005. 1.0
San Marcos will have over 6,000 units. 0.0
If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%. 1.0
That would not be a disaster. 1.0
Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data. 1.0
Let me know what you think. 0.0

The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply. 1.0
We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days. 1.0

  Jeff,  JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L. 1.0
Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million. 0.0
This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached. 1.0
The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million). 0.0
This is probably money coming out of reserves. 1.0
Besides that day there are many smaller differences. 1.0
Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days? 1.0
The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus. 1.0

My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues. 1.0
As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review. 1.0
Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st. 1.0
We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). 1.0
However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st. 1.0
We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week. 1.0
We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510. 1.0

I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and new projects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able to increase the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able to achieve a decent IRR. 1.0
Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increase the cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of new construction. 0.0

I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an= d gave the information to us over the phone. 1.0
The appraised value as built = is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695. 1.0
The problem is the Land Value is $= 1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja= nuary. 1.0
Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top=  of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s= how an increase in value?. 1.0
I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou= r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost = and some other small adjustments to costs. 1.0
This would reduce our overall de= bt and resultant equity requirement. 1.0
The main difference in committing to a=  greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o= ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be= ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. 1.0
I have be= en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec= ts each change will have on your equity and return. 1.0

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. 0.0
I already have my blueprints completed. 0.0
What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof. 1.0
I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. 1.0
The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. 1.0
I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. 0.0
I was wondering about alternatives. 0.0
Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. 1.0
For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. 0.0
He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. 0.0
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. 1.0
But would the foam insulation be as effective? 1.0

*******************
We're not sure what's driving the day to day variation. 0.0
Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. 0.0
We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today. 1.0
From a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. 1.0
I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal. 1.0
The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier. 1.0

 I like the cedar t-111 version better. 1.0
Why don't you tell this shop teacher not to be to comfortable and that you will be taking his job in two years. 1.0
We pretty much make whatever you  would like to the specifications that you prefer. 0.0
All of our buildings are  durable and solidly constructed. 0.0
We build them in our shop and the ownner  is rersponsible for their delivery. 0.0
There is no labor cost so you are only  charged for the materials. 0.0
Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . 0.0
This is the most  economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a  given site. 1.0
This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar  style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. 1.0
We have  usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2" wide door opening. 0.0
I would think that  would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your  dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold  over 30 of these in the past ten years. 1.0
The price on this shed usually  varies between $800 and $900. 0.0
Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is  a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive. 1.0
It has vinyl siding and aluminum  soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe  Pronschinske. 1.0
This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize  and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it. 1.0
Your  dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though. 0.0
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door. 1.0
We are presently  building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up  door. 1.0
The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be  roughly $1500. 0.0
We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your  needs. 0.0
With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the  easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday  October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to  finish that one on time. 1.0
If you have any questions just e-mail me or call: 	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364 	My Home number 715-985-3063. 0.0
Have a good one and take with you later. 0.0

 The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form. 1.0
This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door. 1.0
The effort from the SME's should be complete by Christmas. 0.0
Please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer. 1.0
This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture  Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales. 1.0
I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. 0.0
Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved. 0.0
***********************************************************************  If we do not reach the agreement: 1. 0.0
Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or 				 2. 1.0
Continue "as is" with payment differed for 90 days or merger. 1.0
We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate. 1.0
Any comments or suggestions? 1.0
Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact. 1.0
In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost. 0.0
(it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. 0.0
A total of two sims could be cut one. 0.0
Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting. 1.0

I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 0.0

     Greg,  I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format. 0.0
The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000. 0.0
But there is not a professional management company. 0.0
Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000. 0.0
However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit. 0.0
This would yield an NOI of $240,000. 1.0
Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside. 1.0
The asking price is $2,700,000. 1.0
Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap. 0.0
Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap. 0.0
The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project. 1.0
The cost per square foot is 36.58. 0.0
The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million. 1.0
Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go. 0.0
This property has not been on the market. 1.0
So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it. 0.0
If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million. 0.0
It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants. 0.0
Plus the location is by far the most convenient. 0.0
Financing is the other consideration. 0.0
I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down. 1.0
What do you think could actually be achieved? 1.0
Can you put me in contact with a lender? 1.0
I will follow up with a phone call. 0.0
Thanks,  Phillip 0.0
*******************
 Jeff,  I reviewed your revised offer sheet. 1.0
I am OK with the effective income of $484K. 0.0
Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number. 1.0
The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on. 0.0
$484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI. 0.0
I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon. 1.0
He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization. 1.0
See the attached spreadsheets. 1.0

 Renee,  Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units. 0.0
It is clear that the payment will be made in shares. 1.0
However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares. 1.0

Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock." 0.0

*******************
 Richard,  I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included. 1.0
So that reduces some of the savings. 1.0
Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home. 1.0
Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate. 1.0
Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs. 0.0
I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do. 1.0
What are some other alternatives that would also be effective? 1.0
Radiant barrier? 1.0
More attic ventilation? 1.0
Thank you for your help. 0.0
I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. 0.0
You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. 0.0
that sounds like a lot. 1.0
I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. 0.0
Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. 0.0
If your budget is $85-90 per sq. 1.0
ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management. 1.0

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. 0.0
I already have my blueprints completed. 0.0
What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof. 1.0
I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. 1.0
The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. 1.0
I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. 0.0
I was wondering about alternatives. 0.0
Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. 1.0
For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. 0.0
He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. 0.0
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. 1.0
But would the foam insulation be as effective? 1.0
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. 1.0
I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. 0.0
Thank you for your help. 0.0

*******************
 Mery,  This sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting. 1.0
We should be able to work with this. 0.0
We need to get your approval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the application. 1.0
We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner's decisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in time with wrong answers. 1.0
This will achieve our goal of giving the learners "more rope" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. 1.0
In order to achieve this, we will have the following constraints:    The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's    meeting. 1.0
We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and    positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous    period. 1.0
We will not, for example, be able to say things like "In    November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw    gas. 0.0
What you should have done was..."    We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. 1.0
This means that if the    learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences    a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to    start over at time period one. 1.0
We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,    transportation costs, or hedging instruments. 0.0
This is because the right    answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the    decisions the learner has made. 1.0
Now that the learner can go down any    path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and    the right answers are variable. 1.0
I believe these tasks will be actually    better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already    calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and    conversion and arbitrage scenarios. 1.0
Furthermore, the type of feedback we    would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with    the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this    task. 1.0
We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework does not support the downloading of data into external applications. 1.0
The technical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current development budget. 0.0
We can, however, do some calculations for the learner on the screen. 0.0
We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the mistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices. 0.0
If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day Wednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of this simulation. 1.0
I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please let me know if you would like to set up a meeting. 1.0
Thank you. 0.0

I am still having a tough time making the math work. 0.0
Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment? 1.0
Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect. 0.0
I am writing to tell you about another post office that has just come back on the market...it's in Killeen, and was under contract for about 30 days. 1.0
But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and had designated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, so today he released this one. 1.0
The Killeen post office (Harker Heights, a suburb) is one of the best we have had in our inventory. 0.0
It was built by a developer who is a friend of ours and has been constructing POs for many years. 1.0
She had to turn down two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract. 0.0

 Bob,  I turned in the application for a variance yesterday. 1.0
The hearing will be = on January 8th. 1.0
In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, t= he application had to be in by November 9th. 1.0
I was under the impression th= at yesterday was the deadline. 0.0
Sorry if I dropped the ball. 0.0
=20  On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful su= ggestions about the addition. 1.0
It might be possible to move the addition f= orward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.=   You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new = space for your game/play/music room. 1.0
Then you could close off the existing=  play room to replace the bedroom lost. 0.0
Part of the play room that is bord= ered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for = a built in desk with a couple of computers. 1.0
This way you would not have to=  add a second staircase. 1.0
The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bed= room should be minor construction. 1.0
In the back you could slope the roof un= til you were within the setback. 1.0
Then you could place a large dormer facin= g the back of the property or bring a wall straight up. 1.0
From the driveway = the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be = brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition. 1.0
The kitche= n and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would b= e more shaded. 0.0
That is the west side of the house so that might not be a b= ad thing. 1.0
Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or di= ning room would still be possible. 0.0
Personally, I think opening the dining = room would be the better idea. 0.0
I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exp= loring anything except your original plan. 0.0

Let me know if you want me to try=  and sketch out these ideas. 0.0

=20   Greg,  After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. 1.0
=20  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. 1.0
This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. 1.0
It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. 1.0
In my case this would be as=  of September 30th. 1.0
I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=  of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. 0.0
The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. 1.0
Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. 1.0
Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. 1.0
There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. 0.0
First,=   section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. 1.0
Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. 0.0
The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. 1.0
If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. 1.0
This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. 1.0
However, it states "The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=   This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=  share in the account on January 1, 2001. 1.0
Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. 1.0
The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=  distribution under each of the three interpretations:     Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1  Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar= es Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13 Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658 10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10 Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares  I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair. 0.0
If the = administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7= .1 should apply. 1.0
The current interpretation of the plan administrators is = a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. 1.0
=  =20  In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=  same issue. 0.0
I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt= er. 0.0

I don't want to misrepresent your position to Greg. 0.0
Greg,  After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. 1.0
=20  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. 1.0
This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. 1.0
It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. 1.0
In my case this would be as=  of September 30th. 1.0
I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=  of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. 0.0
The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. 1.0
Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. 1.0
Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. 1.0
There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. 0.0
First,=   section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. 1.0
Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. 0.0
The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. 1.0
If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. 1.0
This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. 1.0
However, it states "The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=   This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=  share in the account on January 1, 2001. 1.0
Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. 1.0
The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=  distribution under each of the three interpretations:     Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1  Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar= es Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13 Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658 10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10 Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares  I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair. 0.0

 Yevgeny,  Please send me an email describing the zero option so I can pass it along to the other SME's. 1.0
Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact. 1.0
In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost. 0.0
(it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. 0.0
A total of two sims could be cut one. 0.0
Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting. 1.0
Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions. 0.0
I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 0.0
Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time. 0.0
We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses. 0.0
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow. 0.0
Is BRM "core" to the Enron for next few months or new organization? 1.0
Please consider the costs of finishing this project. 1.0

 Mike & Tony,  Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs. 1.0
Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close. 0.0
I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis. 0.0
I don't know if this would be agreeable to you. 0.0
Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think. 0.0
If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections. 0.0
I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors. 0.0
We are torn between two good locations. 0.0
However, we are leaning towards Kerrville. 0.0
The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially. 0.0
We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos. 1.0
I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately. 1.0

 Jim,  Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating. 1.0
Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low. 0.0
Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith. 0.0
I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at. 0.0
Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time. 0.0
Thank you anyway. 0.0
We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our '83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping! 0.0
Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner. 0.0
Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr lease originally. 1.0
The other two are new. 0.0
The Roma is like buying a savings account. 1.0
It would be paid off in 10 years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonus kicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease income after it's paid off. 1.0
It would probably go beyond another 10 years. 1.0
Cash on cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma. 0.0
We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us know if you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they will last long. 0.0

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline. 1.0
Any possibility for a=  deal has reportedly fallen apart. 0.0
According to sources, both the Republic= ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. 0.0
The Democratic cauc= us is reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis. 0.0
Many legislative Republic= ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o= nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double=  dip" into the fund. 1.0
Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg= islature and the governor. 0.0
However, it is believed once Davis discloses th= e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac= e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon= g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t= hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. 1.0
If not, the state may be in = breach of contract. 1.0
Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th= e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi= ll be very difficult. 1.0
The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat= e would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately = $8 billion. 1.0
However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this = concession. 0.0
Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful= l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the = details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=  will support the bond issuance to go forward. 1.0
Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB = 31X. 0.0
AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. 0.0
This bi= ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac= k of Republican support. 1.0
AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo= r community college districts. 0.0
However, sources report this bill may be am= ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre= ntly in AB 8X. 1.0
Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get = paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li= kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20 =20 According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic= ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in = the General Fund. 1.0
For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 = of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued. 0.0
Other Republ= icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds. 0.0
The Republicans intend=  to bring this up in debate on  Monday. 0.0
Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo= rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind= ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. 1.0

The $5 billion=  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut= horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi= tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power = going forward. 1.0
Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz= ations. 1.0
Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor = has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is = that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. 1.0
No f= urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it = is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas= ing power. 1.0
Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. 0.0
for  the Calif= ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority. 0.0
However, this can  be consi= dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl= ier in the crisis. 1.0
=20 SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. 0.0
T= he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the = governor. 0.0
The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au= gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. 1.0
According t= o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s= igned it. 1.0
The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi= s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. 1.0
If the legislature indicat= es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank= ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. 1.0
=20  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is= suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s= tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th= en the utilities would receive the residual amount. 1.0
In other words, the st= ate will get paid before the utilities. 1.0
If this language is included and p= assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=  bankruptcy. 1.0
SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=  the DWR proportionately from rate payments. 0.0

 Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. 1.0
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. 0.0
I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. 0.0
I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. 0.0
As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. 0.0
Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. 1.0

*******************
Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. 1.0
I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. 1.0
Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position. 1.0
Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. 1.0
Hope this info helps. 0.0

Here are the main points from their conversation  1. 0.0
Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt  Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that "he was surprised they hadn't already." 1.0
He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that "they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent" and that "their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it." 1.0
He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the "Plan B's" are "speculative" at best. 0.0
He also thought that SoCal was being "naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court." 0.0
2. 0.0
Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough  Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B. 1.0
The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that "$12B was all the market could handle." 1.0
The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office. 1.0
3. 0.0
New Generator Construction  Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will "build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand. 1.0
Angelides expects the state to be "5-10% short on power all summer." 1.0

 John,  Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this. 0.0
However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime. 1.0
I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit. 0.0
The punishment does not fit the crime. 1.0
What message are you trying to send? 1.0
The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times. 1.0
Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes. 0.0
I know these are not your intended messages. 1.0
I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR. 1.0
We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing. 0.0
My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000. 1.0
The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation. 1.0
Please consider these suggestions. 1.0
We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance. 1.0
Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning. 1.0

 Jeff,   The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20. 1.0
You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000. 0.0
It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20. 1.0
Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes. 1.0
But I have not received payment on either. 0.0
Let's try and wrap this up this week. 1.0

A description of the  2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as  well if that's helpful. 1.0
I would be grateful if you can help identify  someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute  to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers. 1.0
If you need more information, please feel  free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number  listed below. 1.0
Thanks for considering, Vicki Arroyo Cochran Director of Policy Analysis         The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001)  Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  "cleaner" than burning coal and oil. 0.0
A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand. 1.0
However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more "dirty" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax). 1.0
The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil. 1.0
Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem. 0.0
The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues. 1.0
A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference. 1.0

 Ina,   I scheduled a meeting with Jean Mrha tomorrow at 3:30 0.0
*******************
I  have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year. 1.0
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the  distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for  power quality reasons. 0.0
The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due  to server farms and technology companies. 1.0
There is a 100 MW server farm  trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months  due to distribution infrastructure issues. 1.0
Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years. 1.0
The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms. 1.0
Fast-forward to summer 2000. 1.0
Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. 0.0
Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com. 0.0
Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle. 0.0
More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy. 1.0
It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites. 1.0
Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities. 0.0
"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. 0.0
"That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries." 1.0
A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads. 1.0
Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. 1.0
The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. 0.0
Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said. 1.0
Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 0.0
For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue. 1.0
On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. 0.0
The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. 1.0
On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures. 0.0
Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate. 1.0
"These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads," said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light. 1.0
"The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 0.0
We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts." 1.0
With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. 0.0
Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. 1.0
In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies. 1.0
"It is probably the largest data center park in the  country," boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. 0.0
Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park. 1.0
After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. 0.0
Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country. 1.0
As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate. 0.0
But it is not just Seattle. 0.0
The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California. 0.0
Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 1.0
While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management. 0.0
"We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle. 1.0
The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed. 0.0
"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. 0.0
"The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way." 1.0

 Mark,   Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal  basis and socal/san juan spreads. 1.0
I listed the days during bidweek that  reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints  before and after bidweek. 1.0
The following observations can be made:    July 1. 1.0
The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs  actual of .79    2. 0.0
Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91    3. 0.0
Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. 0.0
Aug. 1. 0.0
The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs  actual of .99    2. 0.0
Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49    3. 0.0
Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the  monthly postings    4. 1.0
Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. 0.0
Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against  the index, as well as, spreads to other locations. 0.0

 Brad,   With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial  manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an  associate. 0.0
Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a  commercial manager. 1.0
I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to  others in that category at year end. 1.0
Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori. 0.0
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori. 0.0
Let me know if there are any issues. 0.0

 Lucy,   The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better. 0.0
See if you can add  these modifications:   1. 0.0
Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It  should read =c6+d6. 0.0
Then copy this formula to the rows below. 0.0
2. 0.0
Column H needs a formula. 0.0
Subtract amount paid from amount owed. 0.0
=e6-g6. 0.0
3. 0.0
Column F is filled with the #### sign. 0.0
this is because the column width  is too narrow. 1.0
Use you mouse to click on the line beside the         letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 0.0
4. 0.0
After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to  this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond. 1.0

 Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG. 0.0
Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 1.0
Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. 1.0
I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. 0.0
Current price 37  Nat. 0.0
Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? 1.0
To me this  looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,  Tosco, and SLB? 1.0
Thank you,   Phillip 0.0

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%. 0.0
This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. 1.0
Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high. 0.0
Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF. 1.0
It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. 0.0
However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM. 0.0

Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some  price that undercuts the current provider. 1.0
Then once their sales are large  enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. 1.0
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage  the price risk. 1.0

That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. 0.0
Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side. 0.0
On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. 1.0
While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the "scheduled" number. 0.0
The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. 1.0

I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption. 0.0

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide. 1.0
Let me know if this is  O.K. 1.0
as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future. 0.0
Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019. 0.0
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.) 1.0
Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 0.0
139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate. 0.0
Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections. 1.0
Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. 1.0
What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. 1.0
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. 0.0
In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. 1.0
Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. 1.0
There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it. 1.0
The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. 0.0

Are there any other asset management  targets in the west? 1.0
We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management. 1.0
In preparation for that meeting we would like to  gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.   Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are  typical quantities and term on sales? 1.0
Are there any services we provide? 1.0
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? 1.0
Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas? 1.0
We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets. 0.0
For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions. 0.0
This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like. 1.0
Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. 1.0
That  risk may not be acceptable to the desk. 0.0
I will do some investigation of  their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity. 0.0

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline. 1.0
Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart. 0.0
According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. 0.0
The Democratic caucus is  reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis. 0.0
Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into  the fund. 0.0
Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor. 0.0
However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. 1.0
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. 1.0
If not, the state may be in breach of  contract. 1.0
Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult. 1.0
The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion. 1.0
However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession. 0.0
Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward. 1.0
Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X. 0.0
AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. 0.0
This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support. 0.0
AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts. 0.0
However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X. 1.0
Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 1.0
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund. 0.0
For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued. 0.0
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds. 0.0
The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday. 0.0
Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. 0.0
Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority. 1.0
The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward. 1.0
Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations. 1.0
Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support. 1.0
No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power. 1.0
Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. 0.0
for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. 0.0
However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis. 1.0
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. 0.0
The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor. 0.0
The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. 1.0
According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it. 1.0
The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. 1.0
If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. 1.0
The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount. 1.0
In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities. 0.0
If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy. 1.0
SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments. 0.0

 Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. 1.0
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. 0.0
I would suggest holding  the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business  meetings. 0.0
I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is  even desired or necessary. 0.0
As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try  and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working  and what is not. 0.0
Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet  just waiting for their turn. 1.0
The meetings might be better if held in a  round table discussion format. 1.0

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap. 1.0
I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. 1.0
Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position. 1.0
Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda. 1.0
Hope this info helps. 0.0

Phillip 0.0
*******************
Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct. 1.0
At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%. 1.0
This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year. 1.0
Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to "forced" reductions via rolling blackouts). 1.0
Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June. 0.0
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. 1.0
Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year. 1.0
This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug. 1.0
In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. 1.0
Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. 0.0
Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load. 1.0
I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand. 0.0
As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. 1.0
As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish). 1.0
This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC. 1.0
Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production. 0.0
I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. 1.0
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. 0.0
While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer. 1.0
This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer. 1.0
I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available. 0.0
Meantime, I  hope this helps. 0.0

 Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. 0.0
Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? 1.0
What role would you play in obtaining financing? 1.0
Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans? 1.0
Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet. 1.0
I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. 0.0
I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. 0.0
As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. 1.0
I am not thrilled about  such a low return. 0.0
I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. 1.0
Any ideas? 1.0

 John,  Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of  course). 0.0
He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period. 1.0
His existing  contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week. 1.0
He still  wants to receive this payment. 0.0

 Reagan,   Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind. 1.0
Specific features include:   Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs  Wood stairs  Two story porches on front and rear  Granite counters in kitchens and baths  Tile floors in upstairs baths  Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)  Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths  Solid wood interior doors  Windows fully trimmed  Crown molding in downstairs living areas  2x6 wall on west side   Undecided items include:   Vinyl or Aluminum windows  Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room  Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4  sides      I have faxed you the floor plans. 0.0
The dimensions may be to small to read. 0.0
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'. 0.0
For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof,  but   only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage. 0.0
Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design? 1.0
It is basically a  box with a simple roof   line. 0.0
Call me if you have any questions. 0.0

 Greg,  Something that I forgot to ask you. 0.0
Do you know if Hugo is planning to  replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than  the full replatting process of 3 weeks? 1.0
Also let me know about the parking. 0.0
The builder in San Marcos believed the  plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. 0.0
The townhomes  across the street have a serious parking problem. 1.0
They probably planned for  the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. 0.0

 Jacques,  The agreement looks fine. 0.0
My only comment is that George and Larry might  object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the  construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs  of the construction of the Project". 1.0
Technically, that bank lowered the  loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of  equity that would be required. 1.0
Did I loan them $1,300,000? 1.0
I thought it was less. 0.0
Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans,  engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. 1.0
Most of these items are  in a state of partial completion by the consultants. 1.0
I have been speaking  directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. 0.0
I am unclear on  what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. 0.0
The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. 1.0
Do we  need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and  give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. 1.0

 Jacques,  Here is Larry Lewter's response to my request for more documentation to  support the $15,000. 0.0
As you will read below, it is no longer an issue. 0.0
I  think that was the last issue to resolve. 1.0
It is no longer and issue. 0.0
It is not my desire for you to be left with out of pocket expenses. 0.0
The only item from your list that I need further clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions. 0.0
You mentioned that this was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash investment in the land. 1.0
I agree that you should be refunded any cash investment. 0.0
My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the closing statement or on some other document. 0.0

Assuming that  it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents  need to be completed to convey the partnership done. 1.0

 Jacques,  I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of  value and not pay any fees for their time. 0.0
It looks as if we will be able to  use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,  appraisal). 1.0
One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in  extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like  earnest money would be applied. 1.0
I looked at the closing statements and I  didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. 0.0
Can you help clear  this up. 1.0
Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. 0.0
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and  the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities. 0.0
On the other hand,  conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was  clean. 1.0
What is your inclination? 1.0
Call as soon as you have a chance to review. 0.0

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. 0.0
The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended. 1.0
Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. 1.0
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. 1.0
BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however. 0.0
More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter. 1.0

77002-7361  Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout  Dear Phillip and Keith:   We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash  expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of  all note obligations and design contracts.? 1.0
As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and  existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company,  and appraisal total $67,050.? 1.0
The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which  current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. 1.0
Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this  project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design  and other pre-construction elements.? 1.0
As it is a major project for a firm of  our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or  rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 1.0
Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a  percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on  your prior valuation of our time.? 1.0
For the first, we feel that at least 25%,  or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? 1.0
For the  second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per  year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? 1.0
Either of these  valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the  forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. 1.0
?However, in  the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future  projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per  month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? 1.0
As shown in the  attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings  the total net buyout to $78,946.? 1.0
We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? 1.0
However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 1.0
If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? 1.0
The attorneys can then  draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the  Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout  amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. 1.0
Thank you. 0.0

 Gentlemen,  Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to  date. 1.0
I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. 0.0
The property is  still in two parcels. 1.0
Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot  and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. 0.0
He has also completed a  topographical survey and a tree survey. 0.0
In addition, he has begun to  coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the  smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. 0.0
Hugo is going  to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to  complete. 1.0
The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which  $14,000 are due now for work completed. 1.0
We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by  the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. 0.0
If we can  continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. 0.0
Hugo's  number is 512-295-8052. 0.0
I thought you might want to contact him directly and  ask him some questions. 0.0
I spoke to him about the possibility of your call  and he was fine with that. 0.0
Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp  Flores can be used. 1.0
Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. 0.0
We left very  optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. 0.0
Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about  moving this project forward. 0.0

He  wants us to buy him out. 0.0
Keith and I think this is a joke. 1.0
We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to  determine if it has any value going forward. 0.0
I don't believe the architect  work will be of any use to us. 0.0
I don't think they deserve any compensation  for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were  proposing was unsupportable by the market. 1.0
My version of a buyout is attached. 0.0
I need your expert advise. 0.0
I am ready to offer my version or threaten to  foreclose. 0.0
Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? 1.0
Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I  wouldn't think they would stand a chance. 0.0
There isn't any time to waste so I  want to respond to their offer asap. 1.0

*******************
Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. 1.0
There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction. 1.0
First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. 0.0
We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. 1.0
Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project. 1.0
We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000. 1.0

 Darrell,  Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his  excessively high cost estimates. 1.0
As he did not have the funds to take on the  land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me. 1.0
I would like  to proceed and develop the property. 0.0
My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA. 1.0
I would  also like to compare construction and development services between what you  can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with. 0.0

 George,  I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. 0.0
I still have the concerns that I had last week. 1.0
Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. 0.0
I have gathered more information that support my concerns. 1.0
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. 0.0
The components are as follows:       Unit Cost, Site work, &      builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million       Land                      1.15       Interim Financing               .85       Common Areas                     .80       Total                         $10.4  Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. 1.0
Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. 1.0
It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. 0.0
There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. 0.0
I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. 1.0
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. 0.0
After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. 1.0
He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. 0.0
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. 0.0
Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. 0.0
We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to  discuss alternatives. 1.0

 Jaques,  After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different  definitions of cost and profit. 0.0
Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials. 1.0
Then there is a layer of "construction management"  fees of 10%. 0.0
There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money. 0.0
But I think the majority of it is profit. 0.0
Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million. 0.0
Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. 0.0
After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? 1.0
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs. 0.0
George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using. 1.0
I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included. 1.0
George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. 0.0
I will  review and let you know what I think. 0.0
The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. 1.0

*******************
The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. 1.0
LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. 1.0
Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. 0.0
If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced. 0.0
All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0
Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. 0.0
PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. 0.0
I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. 1.0
Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. 0.0

 Lucy,  Here is the rentroll for this Friday. 0.0
Sorry it is so late. 0.0
There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 0.0
1. 0.0
I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. 0.0
The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 1.0

#1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 1.0

 Jacques,  Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? 1.0
The key business points are:  1. 0.0
Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2. 0.0
Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3. 0.0
The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 0.0
4. 0.0
All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 1.0
5. 0.0
60/40 split favoring the investors. 0.0
With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs. 0.0
Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. 0.0
Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping. 0.0
The builders would be requred to fax  all invoices within 48 hours. 1.0
We also would want online access to the  checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing  but invoices were not being submitted. 0.0
Let me know if you can draft these agreements. 0.0
The GP issue may need some  tweaking. 0.0

 Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. 1.0
Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. 0.0
This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer. 1.0
After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash. 0.0
You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email. 1.0
Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. 1.0
Phillip 0.0
*******************
 Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. 1.0
There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this. 0.0
Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns. 0.0
What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. 1.0
The existing note does not come due  until September 2009. 1.0
That is a long time. 1.0
The buyer may have sold the  property. 1.0
Interest rates may be lower. 0.0
I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note. 0.0
Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far. 0.0
Can you clarify the dates in the contract. 1.0
Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? 1.0
Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. 1.0

What is  going on? 1.0
#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit  #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. 1.0
Why? 1.0
I spoke to Jeff Smith. 0.0
I think he was surprised that we were set up with  email and MSN Messenger. 0.0

I let Jeff know  that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the  property. 0.0
Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show  them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. 1.0
Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right  now. 0.0
I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet  but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. 1.0
As Gary and Wade  continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the  property's tenants and reputation. 0.0
The apartments are looking better and  better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. 1.0
Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. 1.0
It  is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move  in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. 1.0
I  realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and  your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be  working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running  an errand for the property. 1.0
I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this  time. 1.0
We can look at again later in the year. 1.0

 George,  The probability of building a house this year is increasing. 1.0
I have shifted  to a slightly different plan. 0.0
There were too many design items that I could  not work out in the plan we discussed previously. 1.0
Now, I am leaning more  towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. 1.0
One  wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3  kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. 0.0
The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. 0.0
This  plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the  courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor  living. 1.0
I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 1.0
The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass  skylights supported by metal posts. 1.0
I am envisioning the two wings to have  single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. 1.0
I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. 1.0
I would  like to come and visit you again this month. 1.0
If it would work for you, I  would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. 1.0
I  would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we  didn't have time for. 1.0
I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 0.0
Call or email to let me know if this would work for you. 0.0

 Jeff,  Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 0.0
1. 0.0
Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and  repairs. 0.0
Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor  cost for repairs. 0.0
There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on  repairs. 1.0
2. 0.0
What is an outside management firm going to do? 1.0
A full time onsite  manager is all that is required. 0.0
As I mentioned the prior manager has  interest in returning. 0.0
Another alternative would be to hire a male manager  that could do more make readies and lawn care. 1.0
If you turn it over to a  management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager  onsite. 1.0
3. 0.0
Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. 0.0
If you  want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 0.0
4. 0.0
Getting cash out is not a priority to me. 0.0
So I am willing to structure  this deal with minimum cash. 0.0
A 10% note actually attractive. 0.0
See below. 0.0
My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. 0.0
This property  definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. 0.0
Sales Price  705,000  1st Lien   473,500  2nd Lien  225,000  Transfer fee    7,500  Cash required   14,500   NOI   100,000  1st Lien    47,292  2nd Lien   23,694  Cash flow  29,014  Cash on cash  200%   These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then  cash on cash return would be more like 300%. 1.0
This doesn't reflect the  additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years  for a higher price. 1.0
Do you want to reconsider? 1.0
Let me know. 0.0

*******************
Cash Needs Highlights: SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. 0.0
Since then SCE has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20 available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. 1.0
The actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. 0.0
II. 0.0
Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. 0.0
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. 0.0
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. 1.0
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. 0.0
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. 1.0
III. 0.0
Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. 1.0
Under=  such=20 scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. 0.0
IV. 0.0
Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. 1.0
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. 1.0
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. 0.0
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. 0.0
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20 Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20 Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. 0.0
This=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. 1.0
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s= =20 Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. 0.0
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th= e=20 end of each year. 1.0
However, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20 D.01-01-018. 0.0
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the TCBA. 0.0
Because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the TRA, are overstated. 0.0
TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU= RN=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. 1.0
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. 0.0
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=  the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the TRA is overstated. 1.0
VI. 0.0
Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. 1.0
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. 0.0
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. 1.0
[there is no Section VII] =20 VIII. 0.0
Earnings of California Affiliates SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period. 1.0

*******************
Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation. 1.0
At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. 1.0
Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. 0.0
However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract. 0.0
Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1. 1.0
Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. 0.0
Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 0.0
2. 0.0
+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45. 0.0
I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon. 0.0

The money would come from changing the basis for the  QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December  (and maybe earlier). 1.0
PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the  Force Majeure notices off the table. 0.0

 By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15  As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile  Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas  storage number. 1.0
The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the  forecast was for frigid weather. 1.0
Traders put the two together, anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 0.0
"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson,  a trader. 0.0
"It makes the market for natural gas." 0.0
But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas  Association's director of gas supply and transportation. 0.0
He had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality. 1.0
"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what  we are reporting," McGill said. 0.0
As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --  and culprits -- is on. 0.0
Some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at Wall Street. 0.0
Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for  the rise in gas prices. 0.0
"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik  told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 1.0
In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 0.0
Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes. 1.0
Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take  precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price  insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared. 1.0
"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul  Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 0.0
But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 1.0
"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to  change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security  Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 1.0

Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is  facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the  previous December's bill. 1.0
Church members are suffering from higher bills as  well. 0.0
The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of  his salary. 1.0
For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 1.0
"It's the talk of the town here," he said. 0.0
A year ago that wasn't a fear. 1.0
Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per  thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile  to drill for gas. 1.0
Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers. 1.0
But trouble was brewing. 0.0
By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand  cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter. 0.0
There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. 0.0
By early November,  prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. 0.0
The federal Energy Information  Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 1.0
But $10 gas was coming. 0.0
Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,  including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets. 0.0
"It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 0.0
Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York  traders. 0.0
Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile  commodity in the world. 0.0
Setting the price   In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas, allowing it to float. 1.0
In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices. 1.0
The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years. 1.0
Suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce. 1.0
And big gas consumers, from  utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use. 1.0
There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas. 0.0
But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to  know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. 1.0
Like all  futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. 1.0
That leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time. 1.0
As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than $7 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 1.0
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's  weekly storage numbers. 1.0
Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter. 1.0
Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in  hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 1.0
Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient. 1.0
But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 0.0
Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994. 1.0
Still, said the  association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 0.0
But some utility executives didn't share that view. 1.0
William Eliason, vice  president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had  continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 1.0
"I was getting worried," he said. 0.0
Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 1.0
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices  dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
Just passing through   Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but  pass their fuel costs on to customers. 1.0
Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas  charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. 1.0
And Missouri Gas  Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 1.0
Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last  month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could  be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve  energy. 1.0
Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to  save an average customer about $25 this winter. 1.0
Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. 0.0
It waited until fall to seek an  extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not  guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 0.0
Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left  customers with such high gas bills. 1.0
And regulators are being asked whether  they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel  costs. 0.0
On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public  Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to  perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 1.0
"Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. 0.0
"It's time to consider  some changes." 0.0

 George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders  profit. 1.0
Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation. 1.0
At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. 1.0
Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. 0.0
However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract. 0.0
Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1. 1.0
Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. 0.0
Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 0.0
2. 0.0
+5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45. 0.0
I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon. 0.0

Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! 1.0
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money  and time remodeling. 1.0
I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes. 1.0
If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor. 1.0
Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. 1.0
This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. 1.0
I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so  I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. 1.0
Is this  right? 1.0
Has the deposit been made yet? 1.0

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself. 0.0
The gov. 0.0
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas. 1.0
He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. 1.0
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared. 1.0
Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. 1.0
The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. 1.0
His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. 1.0
He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level. 0.0
He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW). 1.0
He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. 1.0
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided). 1.0
He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. 1.0
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases. 1.0
As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. 1.0
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". 1.0
Some of these ideas would require legislative action. 1.0
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of  generation plants. 0.0
The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. 1.0
This  was a frequently recurring theme. 0.0
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. 1.0
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. 0.0
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. 0.0
Expand in-state gas production. 0.0
Take state lands gas royalties in kind. 0.0
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. 0.0
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. 1.0
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. 0.0
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). 0.0
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. 0.0
We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. 0.0
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. 0.0
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. 1.0
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. 0.0
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. 0.0
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. 0.0
Thanks to everyone for their help. 0.0
We made some progress today. 1.0

As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1. 0.0
Examine LDC's incentive rate program. 0.0
Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost. 1.0
The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. 1.0
This creates a shortage in later months. 1.0
2. 0.0
California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand. 0.0
Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. 0.0
Specific questions should include:      1. 0.0
Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage? 1.0
2. 0.0
Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system. 1.0
I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand. 0.0
They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less. 0.0
3. 0.0
Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices. 0.0
Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs. 0.0
By design the customers are short at a floating  rate. 1.0
This market has been long historically. 0.0

But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third consecutive day. 1.0
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. 0.0
But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. 1.0
But that still wasn't enough juice. 0.0
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/MWh. 1.0
The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. 1.0
It is free sell power instate above the $250/MWh price cap. 0.0
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. 1.0
The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. 0.0
However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. 1.0
The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. 1.0
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. 0.0
But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. 1.0
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. 1.0
The ISO is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. 1.0
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. 1.0
A stage three is declared when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. 0.0
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. 0.0
"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation," Dorinson said. 0.0
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. 1.0
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. 0.0
The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. 1.0
It's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. 0.0

The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. 1.0
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. 1.0
The ISO manages grid reliability. 1.0
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. 1.0
However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. 1.0
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). 1.0
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said. 1.0

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. 1.0
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. 1.0
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. 1.0
The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. 1.0
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. 1.0
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. 1.0
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. 1.0
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection. 1.0
AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits  The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. 0.0
They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. 1.0
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. 0.0
The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. 0.0
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. 1.0
"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it," Thomas said. 0.0
"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality district's" authority. 1.0
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so. 1.0
Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. 1.0
"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. 1.0
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. 1.0
"We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said. 0.0
"We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited." 0.0
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. 1.0

Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? 1.0
San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. 1.0
The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. 1.0
Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. 0.0
This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. 1.0
If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. 1.0
The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. 1.0

These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). 1.0
Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary. 1.0
We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships. 1.0
The two key points from this data are as follows:   1. 0.0
The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 1.0
2. 0.0
The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily. 1.0
It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that  are dramatically different. 1.0
I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. 1.0
Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers. 1.0
I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index. 0.0
It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index. 1.0
It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to  conduct our physical and financial business. 0.0
Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal. 1.0

 Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index. 1.0
A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. 1.0
At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation. 0.0
Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. 1.0

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. 1.0
LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. 1.0
Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. 0.0
If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced. 0.0
All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. 1.0
If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. 1.0
USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals. 1.0
Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC. 1.0
These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. 1.0
EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. 1.0
As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. 0.0
With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. 1.0
EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals". 1.0
This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. 1.0
This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. 1.0
Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. 1.0
These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. 1.0
As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. 0.0
Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. 1.0
The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. 1.0
This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. 1.0
With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. 1.0
The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. 1.0
Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. 0.0
Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. 1.0
The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. 0.0
The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. 1.0
Phasing works as follows. 0.0
If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. 0.0
Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. 0.0
The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. 1.0
The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. 1.0
Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. 1.0
This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. 1.0
This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. 1.0
CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans. 0.0
First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. 1.0
Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. 1.0
Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. 0.0
We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. 0.0
We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. 0.0
Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value. 1.0
DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. 0.0
The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. 1.0
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. 1.0
For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. 1.0
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. 0.0
At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. 0.0
REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. 0.0
What did you have in mind? 1.0
I would like to use some form of internet based reporting. 0.0
BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?" 1.0
Please expand. 0.0
INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials. 1.0
As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. 1.0
As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. 0.0
CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. 0.0
In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. 0.0
For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. 0.0
Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. 0.0
PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested. 0.0

*******************
As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. 1.0
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. 1.0
This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. 1.0
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. 1.0
As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. 1.0
Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. 0.0
I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. 1.0
Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. 1.0
The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. 1.0
Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. 1.0
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. 1.0
We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. 0.0
Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. 1.0
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. 1.0
This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. 1.0
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. 1.0
As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. 0.0
I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. 1.0

I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. 1.0
A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. 0.0
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. 1.0
The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. 1.0
The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. 1.0
Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency. 1.0
She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. 1.0
There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. 1.0
Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. 0.0

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth. 1.0

We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR. 0.0
It looks as if during  the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but  assigned multiple master deal ID's. 0.0
(the code is "NG-OPT-XL-PRC") For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June:  June 1st  $797 million dollars loss June 2nd +192 million dollars made June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)  This problem makes it impossible to backtest....  Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the  allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily  increasing your limit to $45 million. 1.0
This limit increase is in effect until  July 26th. 1.0
The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution  can be devised..... 1.0

Unfortunately, our customer would like  to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily  is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday)  - so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your  offer. 1.0

or will it triple  count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a  similar calculation on weekends). 1.0
I assume it is the former, not the  latter. 0.0
Is this correct? 1.0
Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the  latter? 1.0
Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't  matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the  average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let  me know. 1.0
Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the  settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD. 1.0
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to  argue for one or the other. 0.0

or will it triple  count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a  similar calculation on weekends). 1.0
I assume it is the former, not the  latter. 0.0
Is this correct? 1.0
Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the  latter? 1.0
Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't  matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the  average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let  me know. 1.0
Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the  settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD. 1.0

The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing.? 1.0
My  short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural  appears to be waning at present.? 1.0
Volume on this rally is  poor, particularly  since yesterday was a decent day to the upside.? 1.0
The  market appears to be  using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels.? 1.0
If  we are at these same  price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely  bullish.? 1.0
Right  here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.? 1.0
Recommend a neutral  stance short-term on natural.? 1.0

 Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures. 0.0
Bill  Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship. 0.0
He is an  extremely creative individual. 0.0
Whalley actually commented on him today as  someone "who thinks outside the box". 0.0
Bill actually sat in a bar four years  and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth. 1.0
He has been  successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. 0.0
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron. 0.0
He throws out  ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one. 0.0
He pointed  out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally  don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for  Enron. 1.0
In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within  reason. 0.0
I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be  considered a high priority. 1.0
I am willing to accept some of the credit risk  exposure as a cost of doing business. 0.0
Bill understands his role as an  independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for  someone with finite capital. 0.0
I place very high confidence in Bill not  conducting high risk trades. 0.0
Having said that, we certainly need to monitor  his credit exposure and continue to require LC's. 0.0
Just understand that he is  at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade  counterparty. 0.0
I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread  option he traded. 1.0
He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the  trading desk, knew it as well. 0.0
There are a couple isolated products that  Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations. 1.0
This  was one product. 0.0
Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing  models created by the research group. 1.0
The problem with these models is that  they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental  price limitations. 1.0
For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible,  for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within  variable cost than the models predict. 1.0
Thus it is necessary to apply a  correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used. 0.0
Obviously,  we have this function in our pricing models. 0.0
I was not aware this  methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models. 0.0
This has since  been changed. 0.0
Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very  few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products. 1.0
Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to  Enron. 1.0
I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting  credit. 1.0
I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade  considering the circumstances. 0.0
If you believe differently, please advise. 0.0

Under the  $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price  curves proportionally shifted. 0.0
Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the  price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX  volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly. 0.0
Key findings include: $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%   $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134%            It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the  financial desk actually decreased. 0.0
This would seem to imply that up to the  seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces  risk). 1.0
But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that  the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and  increasing VaR by 74%. 1.0

This standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and examining data. 0.0
Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more comparable than ever before. 0.0
A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to see how the data standards can be made to work for you. 1.0
There are 25 tables in the standard presented in an excel format. 1.0
The tabs at the bottom of the page will access the additional tables. 1.0
You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use the services of ACN, the American Community Network. 0.0
AEDC has entered into a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for the standards. 0.0
ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. 1.0
It is your call as to which approach works best for you. 0.0
Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic development profession. 1.0
They should be of particular advantage to the many areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't received the consideration they deserve. 1.0
The standards are a great way to tell their story. 1.0
If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the standards and their use. 0.0

*******************
 Just some feedback on our EOL discussion. 0.0
Whalley had similar thoughts about  how to address the ICE issue. 0.0
His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we  post 1/8 on ICE. 1.0
If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server  automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75. 0.0
If someone betters that to 2 bid, we  immediately go 2.25 bid. 0.0
So we are always the best market on ICE so long as  it is not inside our EOL 2-way. 0.0
Thus the only way our best market shows on  ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market  gets shown. 1.0
If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid. 0.0
Our proposal was  that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25. 1.0
Think about which  system you like better. 1.0
Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will  be implemented shortly. 0.0
I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing  a product this week. 1.0
The purpose will be to communicate about the importance  of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving  2-ways and killing the broker markets. 1.0

Enron has given  permission for this firm to handle this, but they need further approval from  each one of you to deal with your backoffice people and with your assistants  in compiling this information to complete their project. 0.0
Below is a more  detailed letter from the firm explaining their work here. 1.0
Please respond to me that I have your approval to give for them to complete  your project. 1.0
The approach we're  taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each  ENA organization's records. 1.0
Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually  a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain  this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. 0.0
We'll then ask  that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our  working contact. 0.0
The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with  their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff. 1.0
There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. 0.0
Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic  records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. 0.0
Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention  requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. 0.0
The Fileplan,  once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility  for it, and how long it must be maintained. 0.0
Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. 1.0
Livelink is an  imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and  then use the "imaged" document viewable from your computer as the working  copy. 1.0
After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to  offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. 1.0
During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic  records. 1.0
We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. 0.0
MSA, SAP, etc.. 0.0
The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we  do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. 1.0
It's simply an  interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions. 1.0
If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call. 1.0
Thank you. 0.0

if it  couldn't do it this year.... A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve  told them to do last bid week. 1.0
Obviously, more gas trying to come out than  is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an  Enron, to inject. 0.0
Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling  it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g,  cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f. 0.0

*******************
The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August 24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go live soon afterwards. 1.0
While market transparency will increase as dealers used to over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview. 1.0
"As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both counterparties," he said. 1.0
"The real strength is that you (still) get the ability to manage your own counterparties. 0.0
"You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put in the credit terms under which you will do business." 0.0
This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a "giant matrix" within the system. 1.0
"(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure they have ever seen the entire market," he said. 0.0
"(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market." 0.0
Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market transparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who fall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said. 0.0
The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network connection. 1.0
Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco <BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>. 0.0
Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives. 1.0
Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power companies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy <UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy <REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>. 1.0
Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to trade a minimum volume. 1.0
TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING    As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes trading over the Internet could boost trading profits. 1.0
"The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a paperless back office can really save a lot of money," he said. 0.0
However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing systems, as they do in current OTC systems. 1.0
Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those players' own risk management systems. 1.0
But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own clearing system. 1.0
"No one really knows how at the moment," Sprecher said. 0.0
"There might be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists peer to peer." 0.0
In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred except those associated with trading. 1.0
Membership is open to any commercial market participant. 0.0
Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which Sprecher assessed at "slightly below the best prices someone would pay in the voice broker business". 1.0

Andy Zipper@ENRON 07/31/2000 01:51 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Houston Street  John,  As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street,  whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. 1.0
The initial thought was  that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care  whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we  could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) 1.0
This still  will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to  reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed  transaction. 1.0
I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I  would like to know. 1.0

 Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold  front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter. 1.0
In  such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how  Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures  were $200. 1.0
The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong,  and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position  currently. 0.0
But in the winter that may change. 1.0
Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the  assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on. 1.0
Assuming we enter  the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long  cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side. 1.0
While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the  payout probabilities may look like the following:  20%  $ -.05 40%     $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1           	Enron North America Corp.

If you  do, we should have finished testing by today. 0.0

 Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree. 0.0
I think consensus  opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the  winter. 1.0
A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection  season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. 1.0
With the most recent AGA, those  projections seem to be closer to 2.7. 0.0
With supply of gas very inelastic to  price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the  equation. 0.0
The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand  (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies  will be stored rather than burned. 1.0
Each AGA number is another data point as  to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a  comfortable level in storage entering the winter. 1.0
A low AGA number  indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up. 0.0
Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be  a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting  noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand  equilibrium. 1.0
We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out. 1.0
If we get two low injections, watch out. 0.0

In the  beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull  case. 0.0
The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under  stored. 0.0
I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change  that expectation. 0.0
However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of  bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news. 1.0
At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come  from the physical market and weather. 0.0

"Cooper, Sean" <CooperS@EPEnergy.com> on 07/11/2000 08:03:41 PM To:  cc:   Subject: El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings  Per Share   http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000711/tx_el_paso_2.html  Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69, an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.40. 1.0
The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share of one-time merger-related items. 1.0
Diluted average common shares outstanding for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. 1.0
Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million in the year-ago period. 1.0
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT. 1.0
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said William A. 0.0
Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy Corporation. 0.0
``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to accelerate in the second quarter.'' 1.0
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first six months of 1999. 1.0
Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515 million in the year-ago period. 1.0
Second Quarter Business Segment Results The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. 1.0
The physical and financial gas and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating significant value in the current volatile energy environment. 1.0
Enhanced trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed to the record second-quarter performance. 1.0
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the reorganization of its business in 1999. 1.0
Weighted average realized prices for the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and $19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from the year-ago levels. 1.0
Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day. 0.0
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million, nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. 1.0
The increase was due primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March 2000. 1.0
Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d. 0.0
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost savings from the Sonat merger. 1.0
Overall system throughput averaged 11.3 TBtu/d. 0.0
During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement filed in March. 1.0
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million compared with $16 million in 1999. 1.0
Higher equity income from projects in Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's investment in the Philippines. 0.0
Telecom Update ``We have made substantial progress in the development of our telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A. 0.0
Wise. 0.0
``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses, we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant Energy, to head our telecommunications business. 0.0
Our expertise in building businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the telecommunications marketplace.'' 0.0
Quarterly Dividend The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on the company's outstanding common stock. 1.0
The dividend will be payable October 2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 1, 2000. 1.0
There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000. 0.0

Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them  for all the locations. 0.0
The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol  curves from historical data. 1.0
I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price  curves for NG and  all basis locations. 1.0
I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor. 0.0
I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. 0.0
And here are the VAR numbers  based on these curves:       5/30/00  5/31/00 AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000 AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761 AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685 AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225  You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. 1.0
I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which  would give more weight to recent data. 0.0
We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect  backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor. 1.0

The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26 where we had some counterintuitive results. 1.0
This book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process. 1.0
It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR  system. 1.0
You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative  basis, jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position. 0.0
This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a  big jump in VaR. 1.0
This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. 1.0
Please, look at column D.  The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:   a. a bug in the code. 0.0
We are working with the person in IT who wrote the                      code to review it. 0.0
b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in                     the fwd vol curve will do it). 0.0
One solution I can  propose, is to develop for                     the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to  review the fwd vol curve                     before it is posted. 1.0
If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,   it can be smoothed. 0.0
Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings? 1.0

In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done. 1.0
Market  conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas. 0.0
Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount  of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very  favorable. 1.0
I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level. 0.0

If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day,  making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10  cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller  size than most people want to trade. 1.0
If we restrict to strikes with a lower  delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a  market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the  money. 1.0
Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way  wrapped around the EOL swap mid market. 1.0
Thus if the front swap on EOL is  4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is  3.75/4.75, 100 up. 1.0
In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a  strike has open interest, we must continue to support it. 1.0
Thus I anticipate  having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves. 0.0
In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles  struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for  what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying  to rip people off. 1.0
Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier  for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more  sense. 0.0
It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL. 0.0
Whereas if  someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to  call ENE to close the trade. 1.0
If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a  market on both the 3100 call and put at all times. 1.0
Secondly, I would  anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just  the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction. 1.0

this month has been frustrating for me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled  all the rest. 1.0
im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. 1.0
was  long mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early   flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. 1.0
if we have sustained aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure. 0.0
but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? 1.0
was just saying to  mark silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 0.0
any great insites? 1.0

First, what happens  if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on  EOL? 1.0
Second, what strike are straddles traded at. 1.0
Are they set at the  nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote? 1.0

 Dutch: The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to  two factors. 0.0
First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics  book due to the nature of the position. 0.0
I am currently using the ltx to hold  longer-term strategic positions. 0.0
The large increase in position is a  reflection of my view of the market. 0.0
Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was  transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until  this morning. 1.0
Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's  position and a corresponding decrease occurred today. 1.0

 I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better  replicate seasonal fundamentals. 1.0
There are convincing arguments as to why  the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time. 0.0
However, in the previous  methodology they blew out. 1.0
For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232  while Cal 10 was .256. 0.0
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the  summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months  of July and August over time. 1.0
The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for  the month as well as for the year. 1.0
These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the  4/5 spread was marked at .0475. 1.0
In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month  premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I  change them 1.0

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at the end. 1.0
You should be ready to defend your answer. 0.0
Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. 1.0
Acquiring a Company       In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer. 1.0
You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. 0.0
The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. 1.0
Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. 0.0
If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. 1.0
But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. 1.0
All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. 0.0
By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. 1.0
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. 1.0
If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. 1.0
Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. 0.0
The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. 1.0
This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. 1.0
From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. 0.0
Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. 0.0
You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. 1.0
Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. 0.0
In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. 1.0
Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. 0.0
As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share. 1.0
What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock? 1.0
$______ per/share 1.0

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at the end. 1.0
You should be ready to defend your answer. 0.0
Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. 1.0
Acquiring a Company       In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer. 1.0
You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. 0.0
The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. 1.0
Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. 0.0
If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. 1.0
But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. 1.0
All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. 0.0
By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. 1.0
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. 1.0
If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. 1.0
Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. 0.0
The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. 1.0
This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. 1.0
From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. 0.0
Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. 0.0
You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. 1.0
Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. 0.0
In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. 1.0
Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. 0.0
As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share. 1.0

Agree - Products Rally is not different for products. 0.0
92% of heating oil is made ondemand   (storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October  and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very  early). 1.0
SOme things to consider : 1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and  be in full blown gasoline season. 1.0
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU 3- nobody will pay any attention to HO 2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly  build slower than last year  4- therefore by September everyone will freak out 5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar  to NG) that the world will not end. 1.0
Where does this get us: 1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind  will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month  avg--therefore less noise) 2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng  puts nov-jan  Ng-Disagree: I think prices stay high through June. 1.0
The big drop off come some where in  July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. 0.0
so yea, my curve is a  touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view. 1.0
most of the move  this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat  market. 1.0

*******************
 unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do. 0.0
the  question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of  correcting for violations of the black scholes model. 1.0
in my mind, there are  three big reasons for skew. 0.0
one is that the assumption of stochastic  volatility as a function of price level gets violated. 0.0
commodities tend to  have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and  elasticity of the demand curve. 1.0
nat gas tends to be relatively stable when  we are in that historical pricing environment. 0.0
however, moving to a  different pricing regime tends to bring volatility. 0.0
an options trader wants  to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the  range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium. 1.0
supports a  vol smile theory. 0.0
in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a  function of price level. 1.0
nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at  $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3. 0.0
thus there has been a tendency for all  calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative  skew. 0.0
the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off  in a declining market and increase in a rising market. 1.0
to test, regress 15  day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation. 1.0
second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution  predicts. 0.0
supports vol smile theory. 0.0
easy to test how your market compares  by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected  distribution. 1.0
third, is just supply and demand. 0.0
in a market where spec players are  bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance  premium to add incremetal risk to the book. 0.0
if you have a neutral view  towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly  fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more  expensive insurance. 0.0
crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak  call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer  fences. 0.0
if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the  fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade. 0.0
if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time. 1.0
hope this  helps, john     Sharad Agnihotri 04/04/2001 12:44 PM To: Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Gas Implied Volatility Smile  John, Mike  I work for the London Research team and am looking at  some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk. 0.0

 Mike: which one of the hedge funds closes today? 1.0
*******************
 yea,  i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the  loss of demand, which is in the first 4 inj numbers. 1.0
customer buying and  fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level. 1.0
if my theory holds,  eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes. 1.0
second  puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis,  demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry  realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you  should, and early winter weather will not match 2000.  we develop large y/y  surplus in x and z.  z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists  for rest of winter. 1.0
by late december, just trying to find a home for gas. 1.0
think decent chance f futures finish with a 2 handle. 0.0

O.K., now breathe out. 0.0
Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you can't see your breath. 0.0
And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin box for the right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. 1.0
Yet last November, Murphy Oil Corp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago. 1.0
The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day, half a world away, at the Hague. 1.0
Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross the zeds and umlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. 1.0
Framework Convention on Climate Change. 0.0
The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological terms--turning the earth into a hothouse. 1.0
But no final accord was reached. 0.0
In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of carbon (the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd. 1.0
The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, and there isn't even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. 0.0
Indeed there isn't even unanimity on global warming itself. 1.0
Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition. 1.0
Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions trading system. 0.0
But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity. 1.0
John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. 1.0
Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto target--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. 1.0
"This isn't an act of altruism," says Aidan Murphy of Shell. 1.0
"It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business." 0.0
And not theirs alone. 0.0
A growing number of corporations, from IBM to your neighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. 1.0
DuPont is pledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010. 1.0
"There's been a shift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since Kyoto," says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. 0.0
"Now the view is that climate change is serious and we ought to do something about it." 1.0
There are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources and "cap and trade" emissions. 0.0
That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas emission and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their allowance or buy credits if they exceed permitted levels. 0.0
The theory is that the pursuit of greenbacks will fuel greener business. 1.0
"Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset," says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at Environmental Defense, "people go out and make lots of pollution cuts." 1.0
Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewing the potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to consider. 1.0
Witness Claiborne Deming, Murphy's CEO, who doesn't see the science of global warming as solid enough yet to cry havoc. 0.0
But Deming hears shareholders clamoring and the bureaucrats buzzing. 0.0
Someone may ask his company to put more than a quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted amount of CO2. 1.0
Breathe in. 0.0
Hold it. 0.0
You know the drill. 0.0
How much CO2 did you just exhale? 1.0
Tricky question. 0.0
Yet that's analogous to the one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. 1.0
Until they figure it out, companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how you buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2) how to do so when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. 1.0
"It's risky as hell," says Deming. 0.0
Many groups are working to mitigate that risk. 0.0
The World Resources Institute and others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky by creating universal carbon-accounting practices. 1.0
And four companies--Arthur Andersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing an exchange where companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid of legislative standards. 0.0
"They're trying to nail down something that will be useful under laws that are not yet defined," says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, an energy-trading firm. 1.0
